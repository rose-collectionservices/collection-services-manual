## 1.1 Rose Library Collection Services Documentation Policy
Documentation policy approved by the Collection Services Documentation Task Force in May 2025.

### Purpose 
This policy outlines the high-level principles and requirements governing the management of Rose Library’s collection services documentation. Detailed guidelines related to platforms and procedures follow the formal policy. 

### Scope 

This policy governs documentation owned and managed by the collection services staff of the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library (defined as staff working in processing, cataloging, or digital archives units or roles). This documentation includes the policies, workflows, processes, guides, manuals, and forms integral to collection services functions and intended for long-term use.  

Collection services staff also rely on documentation maintained by other Rose Library departments, other divisions of Emory Libraries, professional associations and standards bodies, and vendors. While this policy requires collection services manuals link to such documentation for awareness and ease of use, external documentation is otherwise outside the scope of this policy. 

### Ownership 

Each file or manual section constituting official collection services documentation should have a designated owner, typically the job role that directly oversees the documented program or function. Whenever possible, the content owner’s job title or name should be recorded at the top of the relevant page or document. The content owner is responsible for monitoring and maintaining their assigned documentation, advising on revisions, committing changes to official copies, and notifying others when significant changes are made. When necessitated by job responsibilities or personnel change, changes in documentation ownership should be recorded and communicated in a timely manner.  

### Documentation Locations 

Policies governing the creation and management of documentation apply regardless of the platform(s) in use and should remain consistent even if storage locations change over time.  

All current documentation should be indexed in one central location. Information should not be repeated between platforms, manuals, or sections; rather, the central documentation should identify and direct users to any information stored elsewhere. Similarly, files containing documentation should not be copied and placed in multiple locations for convenience or to support project-based worked; project instructions should instead direct users to versions of record.

### Access 

When selecting documentation platforms and setting permissions, staff should make every effort to keep documentation publicly available. This facilitates transparency and version control of our institutional processes, as well as providing an opportunity to share archival documentation with the larger archival community and other interested users. All public content is shared under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) public domain dedication. Sharing of non-public content with stakeholders outside of Emory should be done in accordance with relevant Rose Library policies and approved by the content owner.

### Review and Approval of Documentation 

Any staff member may propose, draft, or revise documentation; however, only designated content owners may commit changes to official copies.  

Content owners may edit documentation directly, without additional consultation or review, where revisions are minor (e.g., small stylistic changes, small corrections or clarifications, etc.). 

Substantive additions or edits, including removals, must be reviewed by the content owner and one additional person before implementation. Documentation that will be broadly used, such as processing workflows, should ideally be reviewed by all staff involved in the process or function it documents. Review should take place within one week of a request being made. 

Creation of or revisions to official policies require additional layers of approval, including, at minimum, consultation with the Rose Library Associate Director and discussion at a meeting of the collection services units. Policies that impact Rose Library teams and functions beyond collection services also require review and approval by Rose Library’s leadership team. 

### Revision of Documentation 

Documentation should be reviewed and revised at regular intervals. More frequent revisions to align documentation with current practices should occur whenever practices change.  

  * The central collection services manual should be reviewed, as a whole or section by section, every five years at minimum.  
  * Staff should review and revise documentation when implementing new workflows or systems, when best practices and guidance from professional organizations change, when a new staff person assumes responsibility for a workflow or system, and when staff agree that current documentation is inadequate. 
  * Staff should review and clean up project-specific documentation upon completion of the project. This process includes deleting extra copies of documentation, moving outdated documentation to the legacy folder, and filing other useful information with administrative or collection records. 

Staff should make every effort to keep active documentation current. When documentation is known to be inaccurate, the content owner must clearly label it with a [status statement](#status-statements) until revisions are complete.  

### Revision of Documentation Management Policy 

This policy may be changed at the direction of Rose Library’s Associate Director or with the agreement of all collection services staff; changes must be announced to and reviewed by all affected stakeholders prior to implementation.  

The documentation procedures that follow this policy are expected to change more frequently to accommodate changes in staffing, workflows, and systems. Procedural changes documented below are subject to the general revision guidelines for collection services documentation. 

## 1.2 Rose Library Collection Services Documentation Procedures
Documentation procedures approved by the Collection Services Documentation Task Force in May 2025.

### 1.2.1 Platforms and Storage Locations 

Below are the approved platforms for collection services documentation and the types of documentation each may contain. 

#### GitHub   

GitHub is the central storage and management system for collection services documentation, including policy and procedure information contained in the collection services manual or in ancillary manuals. The collection services manual in GitHub is the primary access point for all documentation we need to do our work. All information that can be contained in that manual should be, and the manual should link to content that is stored elsewhere (see sections below on SharePoint and external sites). 

All documentation in GitHub is publicly available.  

Rose Library’s GitHub landing page, with links to all GitHub repositories containing collection services documentation, can be found at https://github.com/rose-collectionservices. The rose-collectionservices account is managed by Rose Library’s Associate Director and tied to a collection services Google account; access to this account allows adding and deleting repositories, changing repository settings, and adding and removing collaborators. When new staff members join a collection services unit of Rose Library, the Associate Director should add them as contributors to the appropriate repositories.  

#### SharePoint 

The Rose Library SharePoint library houses: 
 * Policy and procedural documentation owned by processing, cataloging, and digital archives collection staff that is not publicly accessible because it contains confidential or sensitive information (e.g., passwords).
 * Templates that are more easily used when stored in a Microsoft environment.
 * Documentation created for the use of other teams that have designated SharePoint as their system of record, such as guides for curators and donors created for the Collection Development unit or information shared with Public Services and incorporated into the reading room and reference manual.
 * Records that result from, and are used to support, collection services functions but that do not document how such work is done. This includes electronic collection control files, meeting minutes, and project files.
 * Policy and procedure documentation that is either in progress (drafted but not yet added to GitHub) or retired/replaced. 

Any official documentation stored in SharePoint must be linked to (at the item or folder level) from an appropriate location in GitHub. 

#### External Sites 

Documentation used to support collection services functions can also be found on the Emory Libraries website, non-Rose SharePoint libraries, and in Confluence. These spaces are not owned or controlled by Rose staff and so are outside the scope of this policy. However, GitHub should include a link to any such documentation.  

Documentation used to support collection services functions but created and maintained by external organizations (e.g., SAA manuals, professional standards, software user guides) should be linked rather than duplicated in SharePoint or GitHub. Supplemental information about local adaptations may appear alongside a link.  

### 1.2.2 Process for Substantive Revisions 

1. Consult with content owner if proposer/drafter does not own the documentation 
2. Draft revised documentation 
3. Share draft for review by the people required by the policy (see https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/blob/master/readme.md#review-and-approval-of-documentation) 
4. Discuss at collection services meeting, if necessary 
5. Incorporate feedback 
6. Upload to appropriate location 
7. Add or update status label 
8. Announce changes to #collection_services Slack channel (and other Slack channels as appropriate)

### 1.2.3 Status Statements 

Actively used documentation should contain a status statement added by the content owner with the following elements: 
 * “Last revised” (used after any substantive change) or “Last reviewed” (used when a piece of documentation is confirmed to be current but no changes were made upon review).
 * The date of the last revision or review.
 * “Revision needed” (in brackets) after the date when any of the following circumstances apply: the content is known to be incomplete or out of date, the content is newly drafted and still being revised, replacement content has been written but not yet added to the manual.
 * “Content owner:” followed by the role(s) or job title(s) responsible for the documentation.

Examples:  
 * Last revised November 2022. Content owner: Head of Digital Archives.
 * Last reviewed January 2025 [revision needed]. Content owner: Head of Collection Processing.
 * Last reviewed April 2023. Content owner: Audiovisual Liaison.

In GitHub, content owners should indicate the appropriate status by adding the status statement under the top-level heading. If an individual subsection has a status that differs from the rest of the parent section, it should have its own statement. Status statements may include additional details when helpful. 

Documentation in SharePoint should also contain a status or revision statement with the aforementioned elements, although the format is flexible. The content owner should note the status below the header or title,  in the filename, in  the text of the document, and/or in another visible location (depending on what makes the most sense).  

### 1.2.4 File-naming Conventions  

Filenames in SharePoint should include “legacy” or “draft” when applicable, preferably at the beginning of the filename to increase visibility in lists of search results.  

Version numbers or dates in filenames are recommended.  

While staff should link to versions of record rather than creating and storing additional copies of documentation, when creating derivative or convenience copies is unavoidable, staff must rename files to differentiate from the versions of record.  

### 1.2.5 Removal of Documentation 

If a determination is made to remove a manual section or other piece of documentation in its entirety from GitHub, the content owner must notify team members of their intention to remove the content and solicit feedback if appropriate before proceeding.  

If GitHub is the content’s only location, the content owner should save a Word or PDF version, marked as legacy using the convention below, in SharePoint. 

Content owners may delete from SharePoint superseded or unused files that are purely procedural. When the information in SharePoint files relates to broader policies or might be needed as a record of past practice, the content owner should do the following: 
1. Insert a note at the top of the first page indicating the document’s status (e.g. “Obsolete as of 5/22/24” or “Replaced by CS Manual”). When possible, make clear whether the documentation is obsolete (incorrect or officially superseded) vs. legacy (accurate and usable but not reflecting current practice). 
2. Add “Legacy” to the beginning of the filename to signal in lists of search results that the content should not be used. 
3. Move the copy of record into ​Folder icon Legacy CS Documentation.
