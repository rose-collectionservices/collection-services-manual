This document provides guidance on physical processing tasks, according to local policy and practice at the Rose Library. 

## 10.1 Sorting
For more information on sorting, see:
* [Section 4: Collection Analysis](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/04-COLLECTION%20ANALYSIS)
* [5.2 Assumptions and general guidelines about arrangement and description](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/05-LEVELS%20OF%20ARRANGEMENT%20AND%20DESCRIPTION#52-assumptions-and-general-guidelines)

## 10.2 Appraisal and weeding during processing

See [9.2 Appraisal during arrangement](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/09-APPRAISAL#92-during-arrangement)

## 10.3 Routine preservation during processing
[moved from Preservation section] 

Preservation treatment in a collection corresponds to the level of arrangement and description for the collection. During high level/minimal processing, archivists look mostly for large-scale problems that affect the entire collection (or large parts of it) such as mold and water damage; large segments of fragile documents that need to be stabilized or restricted from use; poor packing; lack of folders; and items that need special housing such as oversized or bound material.

During detailed processing, archivists may do more granular preservation work like removing rusty fasteners and sleeving torn documents. Preservation activities at this level should focus on mitigating further damage to the collection and enhancing access for patrons while maintaining efficient use of staff time. For example, staff should always make preservation photocopies of thermal fax paper because there is no other way to prevent loss of information. However, staff should not make preservation photocopies of newspaper clippings as a matter of course because of the common availability of that information.

Conduct the following minor preservation work during granular processing:

* Properly folder and box materials--see [10.4.2 Creasing and stuffing folders](#1042-creasing-and-stuffing-folders) and [10.8 Boxing collections and numbering boxes](#108-boxing-collections-and-numbering-boxes)
* Remove letters from envelopes. This ensures that continued refolding over time in the reading room will not weaken paper fibers and lead to tears.
* Unfold/flatten all documents, including bent corners. As above, this reduces repeated folding and unfolding that weakens the paper and causes tears. Smoothing bent corners prevents papers from catching on each other and causing more damage. Use discretion when unfolding oversized material; if the item does not warrant oversized storage, unfold it as much as possible and leave it in a standard legal folder.
* Remove rusting hardware and fasteners that are causing damage to material. This includes staples and paper clips that are causing physical damage such as tearing and rusty fasteners that have eaten through paper or left stains. This does not include slightly rusted or corroded staples and paper clips that have not caused damage to this point. Stable environmental controls will prevent further damage from developing.
* Photocopy all thermal fax paper (glossy paper similar to receipt paper). The nature of fax paper causes information printed on it to fade over time. Photocopying is the only way to preserve that information. When photocopying, if all of the content of a document transfers legibly to the photocopy, discard the original fax. If severely faded areas of the original fax do not copy and show as blank spots on the photocopy, keep both the original and the new photocopy.
* Do NOT photocopy newspaper clippings as a matter of course because of the common availability of that information.
* Disbind material in three-ring binders or spiral bound booklets that are causing damage or are difficult to folder. Pages that have been stored in three ring binders often stick together over time. Very carefully separate these pages. If they will not easily separate, consult the Rose Library Preservation Liaison.
* Bound items that will fit in a Hollinger document case should be placed in folders and stored as normal. 
* Sleeve torn documents in mylar.
* Flag significantly damaged documents for further conservation treatment. A significantly damaged document is torn in half or still at risk even after it has been sleeved.
* Sleeve old or torn photographs in polyester photograph sleeves. Do not sleeve all photographs as a matter of course.
* Do not attempt to mend documents with pressure sensitive tape, even tape marketed as "archival."
* If you encounter moldy materials, see [12.2 Moldy materials](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/12-PRESERVATION)

For questions about possible preservation needs in a collection, consult the Rose Library Preservation Liaison. When processing is complete, be sure to bring to the attention of the Preservation Liaison all preservation issues that may need to be sent to Preservation for further treatment.

## 10.4 Foldering Materials

### 10.4.1 Use of original folders

If the original folders are in good shape, they may be retained as primary housing for the materials. Always retain original containers and folders if they contain important or substantive writing, or if they bear a unique relationship to their contents; original folders can be inserted into new acid-free folders along with the contents of the folder.  Otherwise, folder titles and other basic information may be transcribed onto acid-free folders and the original container discarded.  If an original folder or envelope is too large or bulky to fit in a standard size box, the relevant information can be photocopied and the original item can be discarded. 

### 10.4.2 Creasing and stuffing folders

* Use legal-size folders as the default.
* When foldering, ensure that the folder is creased to the appropriate width for the materials inside. The folder should fit the contents snugly like the cover of a book. Leaving too much space or overstuffing the folder can cause damage such as slumping and tearing. This includes using a bone folder as needed to create a new crease that is not at the precreased lines.


### 10.4.3 Folder titles

* Folder titles may be formal or devised by the archivist. Formal titles are those transcribed from the original folder or directly from the material itself (e.g., the formal title of a published work). Devised titles are those created by the archivist to best describe the material within the folder.
* See also [7.5 Formatting and Style Guide: Folder titles](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/07-FORMATTING%20AND%20STYLE%20GUIDE#75-folder-titles) for additional guidance on formatting and style of folder titles.

### 10.4.4 Labeling folders

Folders should be labeled with the following information: 

* Abbreviated form of the collection title (usually the creator's last name or an abbreviation of the organization's name);
* Collection number;
* Series/subseries title, if applicable;
* Bolded header, if applicable;
* Box number;
* Folder number;
* When adding folders to artificial (miscellaneous) collections or when interfiling a small number of folders in existing collections (additions), also add the accession number to the left corner of the front flap.

Separate the collection title and manuscript number, series and subseries titles, and box and folder numbers with a slash.  The box number always precedes the folder number.  When using bolded headers, they should be followed by a colon before writing the folder title.  Separate segments of the folder title with commas. 

![Figure 1: Folder labeling](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING/Images/Figure1.jpg "Folder labeling")

## 10.5 Separating Materials 
[moved from Section 8 Restrictions]

For access and preservation considerations, some materials may be physically removed from their original location. Materials can be moved either to different locations within a collection or be removed from the collection and managed separately.

### 10.5.1 Attachments
Items that are attached to each other should only be separated under limited circumstances. Always remove sound or video/film recordings, books, and other bulky items that affect storage when they are attached to letters or other documents. If a photograph or other printed item is attached to a document, there is no need to separate the items unless there is something extraordinarily compelling about the attached item and separate description is required.

If an item merits separation, the archivist should create a [separation sheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EStul3EWAvVLqf7lTER_dfwBhGOl41Y5ZoEes6wzQYkZJQ?e=I8Ddew) to document the relationship between the two items. Complete the form, attaching one copy to the original item and a second copy to the item being removed. Separation should be done judiciously and only in cases where access to the item is significantly improved by separation.

In the case of an audio or video recording accompanying a letter or other document, fill out the separation form and file it with the original document. Create a cross reference to the document in an item level scope and content note in the container list for the audio or video recording. For example [Originally filed in Series 1: Correspondence, Letter from April Chung to May Riley, January 24, 1999]

### 10.5.2 Publications
Published monographs, broadsides, and periodicals that are rare or are closely connected to our broader collecting areas should be removed and cataloged. 

* For publications that do not contain any annotations, signatures, or other unique features, the processing archivist should check the catalog to see if the Rose Library already holds a copy. If so, the item can likely be deaccessioned. Confer with the curator responsible for acquisition of the collection to determine if there's a compelling reason to keep the copy in question with the collection.
* If an item is being removed from the collection to be cataloged separately, complete a ["Removed from MSS Collection (to be cataloged)" flag](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EWRcr9mWsX5Cocagr52UkrgBBmgc-G_MTueHiRd_GBArWg?e=SW7XAL), insert it into the publication, and shelve the item on the designated range on Level 9. When dealing with large quantities, it is more efficient to complete the form electronically and print out the appropriate number of flags. Do not leave books in records center cartons or other boxes on the rare book shelves. When publications are attached to documents and that provenance must be preserved, complete the [Separation Form (Books)](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EQ7V6fQc9g1Bl8hqPq1NSTwBNcXKH5h0gIqhxVGAvnrwqw?e=dxjkzg) and follow the procedures as normal.
* If the publication is being deaccessioned, either return to the donor or to Better World Books as appropriate.

## 10.6 Restricting and redacting materials

### 10.6.1 Restricting materials
For restriction policies, see [Section 8: Restriction policies](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/08-RESTRICTION%20POLICIES).

* Items that are restricted should be foldered separately:
	* If the entire folder is restricted, title it as you normally would. Then at the end of the title write [Restricted until YEAR] if the restriction end date is known. Otherwise simply write [Restricted].
 	* If only individual items in a folder are restricted, separate those items from the rest of the contents of the folder and folder them separately. Handle the original unrestricted folder and the new restricted folder as a series of folders by giving both folders identical titles then adding [1 of 2] and [2 of 2] at the end of the title. If necessary you can use a [MSS separation sheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EStul3EWAvVLqf7lTER_dfwBhGOl41Y5ZoEes6wzQYkZJQ?e=I8Ddew) or [an EUA separation sheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/ER0YmElt_wVApRIfeUUaq9cB1uAjrYWzz7TYQgMD5YlfKw?e=AcC5UV) to document the separation of the restricted items; however, typically this is not necessary because giving the folders the same title is sufficient, as it indicates that the contents were originally part of a single folder. At the end of the restricted title write [Restricted until YEAR] if the restriction end date is known. Otherwise simply write [Restricted].
* For items restricted for preservation reasons, when possible create access copies or digital surrogates for fragile material, so that the access copy can be made available to researchers while the original fragile item remains restricted.
* Materials deemed restricted must be boxed separately and should be boxed in a way that facilitates providing access to the material once the restrictions have expired.  For example, if there are multiple levels of restriction in a collection, box materials subject to the same restriction end date together; for example, box all materials that can be opened to researchers in 2030 together.  When the restriction expires, the box can simply be relabeled and restrictions governing access notes removed.
* Labels on restricted boxes must be stamped RESTRICTED. See [10.9.3 Labeling restricted material](#1093-labeling-restricted-material)

For restriction notes and making materials non-requestable in ASpace, see [6.1.18 Conditions Governing Access.](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/06-DESCRIPTION#6118-conditions-governing-access)


### 10.6.2 Redacting materials

Often, rather than restricting an entire document, you can simply redact the information in question and provide access to the altered copy in place of the original.   

To redact information, either:

* Place an opaque bit of paper over the information to be redacted and make a photocopy (do not adhere the paper to the original document);
* Include the following text on the photocopy:  "This is a redacted copy of the original document, with [redacted information, i.e. Social Security Numbers] obscured to protect the privacy/security of the individuals mentioned." 

Or:

* Make a photocopy of the original document;
* Using a black Sharpie marker, block out the information to be redacted on the photocopy;
* Make a second photocopy and dispose of the first copy in the confidential shredding bin;
* Repeat if sensitive information is still visible on the second copy;
* Include the following text on the photocopy:  "This is a redacted copy of the original document, with [redacted information, i.e. Social Security Numbers] obscured to protect the privacy/security of the individuals mentioned." 

NEVER redact the original document itself.  If the original document has intrinsic value (original correspondence, etc.), restrict the document as normal and retain in the collection.  If the original document is not unique (forms, title pages without annotations, etc.), the original can be discarded in the confidential shredding bin. 

## 10.7 Quick Guide to Processing Special Formats

### 10.7.1 Newspaper clippings

Newspaper clippings should be appraised for their relevancy to a collection and only those that are about the creator or their work should be kept.  Clippings are commonly available outside the archives and should never be arranged or described in detail.  They can be described as "Clippings, [date range]" and be boxed or foldered without sorting.  Preservation photocopies should not be made, nor should clippings be unfolded to create oversized papers (OP).  Weed duplicates if they're obvious, but do not waste time trying to identify duplicates. 

### 10.7.2 Quick Guide to Processing Photographs 

Generally speaking, in collections where photographs are only one of the formats, the photographic value of the material is usually incidental. In these cases, item level arrangement and description is almost never warranted. Photographs can be arranged and described at the file level and will mostly not be sleeved. Photographs that are attached to paper documents or part of subject files should be left in their original locations; see [10.5.1 Separating materials: Attachments](#1051-attachments) for additional guidance on when and how to separate photos. If photos are put at increased risk of degradation because of their proximity to newsprint or other formats in a subject file, use folder inserts to segregate the photographs. Early or rare photographic formats may require additional considerations, even in a mixed format collection. Fragile photographs should always be sleeved and stored with care.

For additional guidelines and detailed information about processing photographs, see [11.1 Format-Specific Procedures](.

### 10.7.3 Processing Audiovisual Media
Content owner: **Anicka Austin**

[This section needs to be updated.]

Audiovisual materials can be described separately by format or intellectually with other records by function.  Physically, sound and video recordings should be housed in audiovisual (AV) masters boxes.  For preservation purposes, sound and video recordings should be housed separately when possible.  When working with a small amount of recordings, everything can be housed together in one box. 

In order to keep the Rose Library in line with current best practices and standards, the arrangement and description of audiovisual materials in our holdings was changed based on the documentation of the Archives of American Art grant project (CLIR, "Hidden Collections," 2012-2015).  More information about that project is available on AAA’s website (http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/projects/clir).

Since The Rose Library is conducting more thorough processing at the point of accession, much of the arranging and describing of audiovisual materials will be done at this point, focusing mainly on the physical storage and identification of the materials rather than on the intellectual arrangement of the materials in a finding aid.

For more information on the Audiovisual Liaison workflow for digitization of materials, please use this [document ](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EUqt0cH4y2tPuj6W1wXNdDgB3kq8wxMglsmifxg-Yt6RAw?e=T7c85r> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EUqt0cH4y2tPuj6W1wXNdDgB3kq8wxMglsmifxg-Yt6RAw?e=T7c85r").

#### 10.7.3.1 Accessioning/Minimal Level Processing of AV

Audiovisual materials will be rehoused upon accessioning into boxes labeled "AV."  If more than one box is used, it is preferable to keep audio and visual boxes (e.g. keep all audio together in one box and remove video to another as this will aid in digitization procedures).  Individual items can be rehoused as well at this point (audiocassettes should be in some kind of case) to ensure that damage does not occur.  

#### Rehousing upon accessioning

Upon accessioning, materials should be rehoused into AV Masters boxes.  Some individual materials may require rehousing (i.e. the individual cases or boxes for tapes), but archivists should use their judgment as to whether this is necessary.  It is preferable to do if the housing or item is broken, deteriorating, or unsupportive.  Original housing that is not broken and does not have acid stains or discoloration is adequate and can generally be left alone.  Materials that come in without sufficient housing or cases should be placed in one. should be housed.

When replacing housing, unless the original housing is completely blank, photocopy old housing and folder the copy of the original container in its entirety with the media object (to later be cross referenced). If you are removing the housing, be sure to photocopy printed information on the original media housing that relates to the media such as brand, footage length, tape thickness, etc. 

In cases, where there are only a few phonographs, we utilize the CLPs, or combined LP boxes which house items from collections that would not fill an entire LP box.  Since many phonographs require boxes that are taller than ordinary Hollinger boxes, they require special shelving, so we house materials from multiple collections within one box to save space, hence the title "combined LP." The phonographs should be labeled with a divider that identifies the collection with the MSS number and collection name. The label on the box should reflect the collections held within the box.  While preferable to keep materials from collections together, it is not necessary. This can be done at the point of accessioning to ensure the preservation of materials that may not be fully processed quickly.

Since The Rose Library is conducting more thorough processing at the point of accession, there are two levels that will be used to arrange and describe the materials at this point: enhanced and minimal. 

* Enhanced arrangement and description:
	* If there are few items, the items should be listed out at the title level if the item is labeled. Include notable access points for researchers (e.g. names of important figures, exhibition titles or locations, or titles of media artworks).
	* If the materials are part of an obvious series (i.e. "part 1, part 2…") the items can be listed at a single level with a note about the number of items and date range.
	* If any detailed documentation of materials' content exists in the collection (e.g. transcripts, shot lists, or logs describing content), cross reference the documentation rather than describing any detailed content of the media itself in the finding aid.
	
**NOTE:** At the point of accessioning, unidentified audiovisual items can listed as an unidentified series/subseries/bolded header.

* Minimal arrangement and description:
	* Items should be removed to an AV Masters box.
	* Brief content description taken from labels on media or accompanying documentation. Just listing that the box contains audiovisual materials is not enough, and care should be taken to provide content description. 
	* Grouping related to media is sufficient if unable to verify specific content or sequence of media items.
	* Number of materials and formats should be noted.
	* Duplicate and originals will be filed together if possible.
	
* In both cases: 
	* If physical media is labeled with a lot of detail, it is not necessary to include all detail in the finding aid, containers with content written on them should be photocopied and cross referenced with the item.
	* At the point of accessioning, there is no requirement to play media to identify content. Audiovisual material with no documentation should be labeled "unidentified," and further described by physical format (e.g. "unidentified, undated [original: audio cassette]").
	* If unlabeled media is found with paper records but the relationship is unclear, it is better to leave it with those records to preserve a possible relationship; the presence of AV can be noted in a scope note for the paper component. 
	 
	 If materials are commercial recordings and will not be digitized or made available to researchers, the physical items can be removed from the collection.  However, if this is done, and the archivist should note the identity of each title with the following language: 
	
	"Researcher access is restricted due to copyright; there is no access copy. Original recording was removed from holdings"
	
	The following language should be included at the series and/or subseries level regarding the accessibility: 
	
	"Commercial recordings are not digitized and content is not available due to a risk assessment of copyright restrictions.  A list of titles are included in the inventory for researchers to identify the holdings of the creator.  These materials are available commercially and can be accessed via other sources."
	
At this time, the accessioned materials should be listed in the [Additions to the Audiovisual Inventory form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=nPsE4KSwT0K80DImBtXfOB8h8E_9r5RCthRr1wsf1axUNjFITEY4U1JVUzZDRTlCV1RGOEZBMFNCQS4u) for future digitization.  These materials will be considered backlog for digitization and the location will be noted in the [Master Shelf List](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/BoxDeletedUsers14/EZiyR14OgtROk_YUuYsg6MEBiy1izTutJ3BUfHmJM7wAxg?e=gCYaC3).

#### 10.7.3.2 Granular Processing of AV

Audiovisual materials should be fully processed in conjunction with the paper materials of the collection, and minimal level processing should have been done at accessioning, so materials should be identified at least at that level.  It is likely that as of 2016, most collections will have not gone through the accession procedure listed above, so extra attention should be paid to those materials that have not been identified.  Regardless of the accessioning procedure followed, the following will need to be done for identification:

* If not accessioned to the standards expressed in this document (i.e. if no processing at the point of accessioning has been done), item-level (or at least subject-level) description should be completed.  
* If there is no identification or the labels are ambiguous, the Audiovisual Conservator should be contacted to schedule a time to play the items.  In many cases, the Audiovisual Conservator or staff will review the content as digitization is happening, and they will notify the archivist of non-archival materials for further review. 
* Sound recordings should be grouped physically with other sound recordings while video recordings should be grouped with other video.  If the total amount of audiovisual materials is less than a half linear foot, all audiovisual material should be placed in the same box.
* If a recording has extensive, detailed labeling that adds to the description, photocopy the item and cross reference it in the finding aid.  This can be done by creating folder titles or bolded headers.

To keep the Rose Library in line with current processing standards, audiovisual materials will be arranged intellectually with materials of the same subject.  For example, if there are recordings of poetry readings by the creator, those items should be listed in the series that contains other writings.  In some cases, these materials will not fall under another series value and will require their own series, for example “Interviews and Lectures.”  Series can also be expanded, so “Writings” may become “Writings and Creative Works” or “Printed material” may be expanded to “Printed and Presented works."

While it is recommended to physically keep audio and visual materials separate, they should be combined within the finding aid by intellectual content.  

Also, recordings of meetings can be arranged within an administrative record series.
If there is content of multiple subjects on a single tape (i.e. multiple presentations on a VHS tape or two distinct meetings on either side of an audiocassette), describe each intellectual item in a separate component in the finding aid and note where the item is found on the tape if known.

While we can refer to the individual cassette, film, or tape as an item, it is important to remember that, like folders, the audiovisual item holds more than just "an item." When processing, you should consider them as containers.  While a paper manuscript may be one thing, it is made up of multiple sheets and is arranged and described at the file-level, and identifying audiovisual items this way keeps us in-line with best practices. 

To identify the material within the finding aid, folder titles that include audiovisual items should end with [original: format type].  For example:

![Figure 14: Representing AV in the container list](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING/Images/Figure14.jpg "Representing AV in the container list")

Note: Image includes a date format that is no longer used.  The approved format is Year Month Day.

There is no need for a folder number within the AV box.  In some cases, as in off-site digitization projects involving a large number of items, these item-numbers will be generated for the purpose of tracking the materials.  In this case, we will keep the numbers.  Instances where item-numbers (usually transferred to a folder number in the finding aid) should not be compiled just to have a folder number (i.e. if the number isn't needed for an external cause, we do not create this numbering system for processing). If this information is available, it can be used, but collections with small amounts of audiovisual materials, this is unnecessary.

Duplicates should be kept until material is digitized whereupon they can be considered for weeding.

Phonographs, because of their size, often do not fit on regular sized shelves and are housed on the LP shelves in the Nunnery. In the case that there are not enough LPs from one collection to fill a phonograph box, they may be housed in one of the combined LP (CLP) boxes. For CLPs: The container list will include the actual CLP number in the box column with a dash in the place of the folder number.  For example:

![Figure 15: Representing CLPs in the container list](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING/Images/Figure15.jpg "Representing CLPs in the container list")

Note: Image includes a date format that is no longer used.  The approved format is Year Month Day.

Unless otherwise identified, “phonograph” is a catch-all for the various forms of recorded disks.  Care should be made to identify the type, but this will allow for enough definition until digitization. Processing staff should use the [Media Guide](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Audiovisual%20Materials/Audiovisual%20documentation_administrative/Media%20Guide.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=vawA0O) to identify formats.

#### 10.7.3.3 Notes on Access to Commercial Recordings
If materials are commercial recordings and will not be digitized or made available to researchers, the physical items can be removed from the collection. However, if this is done, and the archivist should note the identity of each title with the following language:

"Researcher access is restricted due to copyright; there is no access copy. Original recording was removed from holdings"

The following language should be included at the series and/or subseries level regarding the accessibility:

"Commercial recordings are not digitized and content is not available due to a risk assessment of copyright restrictions. A list of titles are included in the inventory for researchers to identify the holdings of the creator. These materials are available commercially and can be accessed via other sources."

## 10.8 Boxing Collections and Numbering Boxes

### 10.8.1 General guidelines
* Processed collections should be placed into acid-neutral, archival containers.  In the Rose, we primarily house collections in Hollinger document cases or Paige Miracle boxes.  These boxes are expensive and should not be used for temporary storage projects in cases where the boxes will be broken back down at the end of a project.
* Folders should be packed within boxes so that the folders fit snugly. The box should be full enough that folders do not slouch, but not so full that folders cannot be removed easily. If a box is properly packed, a single folder can be partially lifted from the box and not fall back down, and there should be enough room that the archivist's fingers just reach the bottom of the box. Partially filled or overstuffed boxes cause damage such as slumping and tearing. Spacers should be used when there are not enough folders to fill a box properly (usually necessary in the last box of paper materials in a collection or at the end of a series). If materials have been removed for preservation or exhibition, space should be held for those materials when boxing.
* Boxes in a collection should get numbered in a single sequence, with the exception of boxes with other naming conventions (see below). Numbers on box labels should say "Box 1," "Box 2," etc.

### 10.8.2 Box naming conventions by shelving location

See [Section 13.2 Box naming conventions by shelving location](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/13-STACKS%20MANAGEMENT#1312-box-naming-conventions-based-on-shelving-locations)


### 10.8.3 Materials that should be boxed separately

* **Restricted material** must be housed separately from the rest of the collection and the label stamped as restricted; [see 10.6.1 Restricting materials](#1061-restricting materials) and 10.9.3 Labeling Restricted Material (#1093-labeling-restricted-material).

* **Audiovisual materials** in granularly processed collections should be housed separately and placed in boxes labeled "AV"; see [10.7.3 Processing audiovisual media])(#1073-processing-audiovisual-media).

* **Born digital materials** in granularly processed collections should be housed separately and placed in boxes labeled "BV"; [see 10.7.4 Processing digital media](#1074-processing-digital-media)

* **Materials that have been treated for mold** must be housed separately from the rest of the collection and a moldy label affixed; see [12.2 Moldy materials](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/12-PRESERVATION#122-moldy-materials)) and [10.9.2 Labels for materials treated for mold](#1092-labels-for-materials-treated-for-mold). 



### 10.8.4 Oversized materials

* Use discretion when unfolding oversized material; if the item does not warrant oversized storage, unfold it as much as possible and leave it in a standard legal folder.
* Oversized material that fits into a box should be boxed. It is strongly preferred to have a box as the top container if possible.
* All top containers should have a printed label (including OP and XOP folders). 

* #### 10.8.4.1 Oversized boxes that will be stored at the LSC (typically up to 20x24")(treat as regular boxes)
	* It is strongly preferred for all new collections to be sent to the LSC
	* Any oversized material that fits into a box and will be stored at the LSC should be given **regular box and folder numbers** in sequence with material stored in other box types. OP numbers should **not** be used for boxes being sent to the LSC, since OP indicates a shelving location.
 	* Treat bound volumes up to 20x24" as you would any other oversized material. House it in an appropriately sized box and label it with regular box numbers. When boxing multiple items together, insert a strip of acid-free card stock into each item identifying and numbering it. In ASpace, for each item in the box use child type indicator of "item." Oversized bound volumes should be sent to the LSC whenever possible.

* #### 10.8.4.2 Oversized boxes that will be stored onsite (typically up to 20x24") (OPs)
	* Folders up to 20x24" should be placed inside an appropriately sized box.
 	* Oversized bound items that are too large for a document case should be housed in an appropriately sized box. When boxing multiple items together, insert a strip of acid-free card stock into each item identifying and numbering it. In ASpace, for each item in the box use child type indicator of "item."
 	* When a collection is being stored onsite, the oversized boxes will remain onsite as well and will be handled as OPs (oversized papers)
   	* OP boxes should be given OP numbers to indicate that it is being stored onsite on the OP shelves. In a collection OPs should be given a separate sequence of numbers from the general box number sequence (i.e. OP1, OP2, etc.). When making the label, there is no space between OP and the number (i.e. OP1).
     	* Folders within an OP box are also numbered sequentially in the same fashion as regular size folders, for example OP1/1, OP1/2, etc.
   	* Any box designated as an OP must be stored onsite on the OP shelves on Level 11 		
* #### 10.8.4.3 Oversized folders larger than 20x24" and up to 38x34" (OPs)
	* Oversized material larger than 20x24" will not fit in a standard oversized box (the largest standard sized box that we typically order is 20x24"), but larger or custom boxes can be ordered in some instances.
 	* If the oversized material will not fit in a box, it should be placed in an oversized folder as the top container.
  	* Oversized folders of these dimensions (i.e. will fit on the OP shelves) should be handled as OPs.	
  	* Rolled items and scroll boxes that will fit on 38x34" shelves should also be handled as OPs.
  	* OP folders, rolled items, and scroll boxes serve as top containers in ASpace
  		* OP folder container profile in ArchivesSpace = box folder (38x34 or less)
  	 	* Rolled item container profile = rolled item
  	  	* Scroll box container profile = scroll box [choose best size]
  	* OP folders should be given OP numbers to indicate that they are being stored onsite on the OP shelves. In a collection OPs should be given a separate sequence of numbers from the general box number sequence (i.e. OP1, OP2, etc.). When making the label, there is no space between OP and the number (i.e. OP1).
 * #### 10.8.4.4 Oversized folders larger than 38x36" and up to 56x34" (XOPs)
 	* Any oversized material larger than 38x36" should be handled as an XOP because it will need to be stored on the XOP shelves in the Nunnery.
  	* Oversized artifacts and computer hardware that need to be stored on the XOP shelves due to size should also be handled as XOPs.
  	* XOPs serve as top containers in ASpace
   		* XOP folder container profile in ASpace = box folder (56x34 or less)
     		* Rolled item container profile = rolled item
  	  	* Scroll box container profile = scroll box [choose best size]	  	  		  	
  	  	 
* #### 10.8.4.5 Legacy content: Bound volumes
	* At one point Rose Library treated bound volumes as a separate format that was boxed and shelved separately. Bound volumes included ledgers, scrapbooks, photograph albums, etc.  	
	* Historically bound volumes were handled as BVs or OBVs based on size and were shelved on the BV and OBV shelving on L11.
 	* New BVs should not be created; box and treat bound volumes the same way as any other oversized material.
  	* Under rare circumstances you may need to create a new OBV if a volume is too large for a 20x24" box and must be stored onsite. In those rare cases, it should be identified with a strip of acid-free card stock inserted into the volume, given an OBV number, and stored on the OBV shelves on L11.
 
        
* #### 10.8.4.6 Framed items
	* When possible, framed items such as photographs, certificates, or artwork should be unframed and boxed according to the size of the item. See guidance above on oversized boxes.
	* If it is not possible to remove the frame but the frame will fit in an oversized box, put it in an appropriately sized box and pad the item with pH buffered paper or bubble wrap. **Do not send framed items with glass to the LSC.** Boxes containing glass must be stored onsite and should be handled as an OP. Affix a label that says "caution: glass".
	* Framed items that are too large to be boxed should be handled as a FR (framed item), which will be stored on the art racks on L11:
 		* Framed items should be given an FR number to indicate that it is being stored onsite on the framed art shelves. In a collection FRs should be a separate sequence of numbers from the general box number sequence (i.e. FR1, FR2, etc.). When making the label, there is no space between FR and the number (i.e. FR1).
     		* Label it. Do not affix labels to the frames themselves. Print a small (4" x 2") label, affix the label to a strip of acid free card stock, punch a hole in the top, and tie the label to the hanger on the frame. 
		* The framed item serves as a top container in ASpace. Container profile in ASpace = [blank]
  		* If the frame does not have hanging hardware on the back, consult with the Rose Library Preservation Liaison.
    		* Do not add any framed items to the art racks without first identifying and labeling them appropriately. 




## 10.9 Labeling boxes

### 10.9.1 Creating box labels

All top containers should have a printed label. Box labels should include the following information (see figure 2 for an example): 

* Emory University;
* Rose Library;
* Manuscript or EUA number;
* Main entry (dates do not have to be included and should not be included if they're subject to change, i.e. if the person is still living); 
* Collection title (do not include the date range in the title statement since it will change in the event of accruals);
* Box number.

*Figure 2*

* There are two options for creating labels:
	* Generate a label via ASpace (if that works on your computer).
 	* Use one of the Word label templates:
  		* Record storage boxes, document cases, OP folders, and XOP folders: [4" x 3 1/3" labels](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Manuscript%20Box%20Labels/MSSlabels%20101-200.doc?d=w22bbbb9e7367446a8b9f668b968c1827&csf=1&web=1&e=zxIl64).
    		* Slim document cases and oversized boxes that are 3" in depth: [4" x 2"](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Manuscript%20Box%20Labels/MSSlabels%20[small]%201-100.doc?d=w33190c2d0c574d44a4ce8d245a1ebf84&csf=1&web=1&e=NYu0hh)
      		* Oversized boxes that are 1.5" in depth: [additional template for the 4" x 2" labels](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Manuscript%20Box%20Labels/MSSlabels%20[1.5%20depth%20boxes].doc?d=w894f959bdda44618866d3fb30162f097&csf=1&web=1&e=7SKAx4) 

### 10.9.2 Affixing box labels and barcodes

**Examples:**

*Document case (.5 linear feet):* Label should be placed in the middle, under the flap. The barcode should be placed on the middle of the bottom of the flap.

<img src="https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/blob/master/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING/Images/Figure3new.jpg" width="300" />

*Slim document case (.25 linear feet):* Label should be placed in the middle, under the flap. The barcode should be placed on the middle of the bottom of the flap.

<img src="https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/blob/master/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING/Images/Figure4new.jpg" width="300" />


*Record storage box (1 linear foot):* Label should be placed in the middle, under the handle with enough room to place the barcode between the handle and the label. 

<img src="https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/blob/master/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING/Images/Figure5new.jpg" width="300" />


*Oversized box:* Label should be placed on the left side of the front of the box (the smallest dimension is the front of the box). The barcode should be placed to the right of the label. 

<img src="https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/blob/master/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING/Images/Figure6new.jpg" width="300" />

### 10.9.3 Labels for materials treated for mold

Boxes that have been treated for mold must be housed separately from the rest of the collection and should be labeled with a mold notice label, which should be printed on white paper. (Legacy note: Previous versions of mold labels were printed on bright colored paper; we have moved away from this so the labels are less alarming to researchers.) The label should be affixed to the end of the box. Oversized boxes may not always have enough space on the front for the label. In this case, put the label in a logical place on the front and/or top of the box so they are visible to staff and patrons. Use scotch tape to affix the label to the box but make sure the labels are taped on all sides. See figures 7-9 for examples.

[Link to mold notice label](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EQ2ks6eu6e1GjHr1Cpv4_9QBgir9FIB9IuIerb3-88_uNg?e=zsUoTU)

### 10.9.3 Restricted stamps for labels

See [6.6.1 Restricting materials](#661-restricting-materials) for how to folder and box restricted material.

Restricted boxes that are not requestable by researchers should be clearly stamped with the red RESTRICTED stamp (see figure 10). 

![Figure 10: Restricted material](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING/Images/Figure10.jpg "Restricted material")

*Figure 10*

There may additionally be other kinds of restrictions on how patrons may use material, such as **prohibitions on photography** or **reproduction restrictions** that are also indicated by a stamp on the label. See figures 11-13 for examples.



*Figure 11: No personal photography*
