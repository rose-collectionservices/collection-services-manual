In order to keep the Rose Library in line with current best practices and standards, the arrangement and description of audiovisual materials in our holdings was changed based on the documentation of the Archives of American Art grant project (CLIR, "Hidden Collections," 2012-2015).  More information about that project is available on AAA’s website (http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/projects/clir).

Since The Rose Library is conducting more thorough processing at the point of accession, much of the arranging and describing of audiovisual materials will be done at this point, focusing mainly on the physical storage and identification of the materials rather than on the intellectual arrangement of the materials in a finding aid.

## 6.5.1 Accessioning/Minimal Level Processing

Audiovisual materials will be rehoused upon accessioning into boxes labeled "AV."  If more than one box is used, it is preferable to keep audio and visual boxes (e.g. keep all audio together in one box and remove video to another as this will aid in digitization procedures).  Individual items can be rehoused as well at this point (audiocassettes should be in some kind of case) to ensure that damage does not occur.  

### 6.5.1.1 Rehousing upon accessioning

Upon accessioning, materials should be rehoused into AV Masters boxes.  Some individual materials may require rehousing (i.e. the individual cases or boxes for tapes), but archivists should use their judgment as to whether this is necessary.  It is preferable to do if the housing or item is broken, deteriorating, or unsupportive.  Original housing that is not broken and does not have acid stains or discoloration is adequate and can generally be left alone.  Materials that come in without sufficient housing or cases should be placed in one. should be housed.

When replacing housing, unless the original housing is completely blank, photocopy old housing and folder the copy of the original container in its entirety with the media object (to later be cross referenced). If you are removing the housing, be sure to photocopy printed information on the original media housing that relates to the media such as brand, footage length, tape thickness, etc. 

In cases, where there are only a few phonographs, we utilize the CLPs, or combined LP boxes which house items from collections that would not fill an entire LP box.  Since many phonographs require boxes that are taller than ordinary Hollinger boxes, they require special shelving, so we house materials from multiple collections within one box to save space, hence the title "combined LP." The phonographs should be labeled with a divider that identifies the collection with the MSS number and collection name. The label on the box should reflect the collections held within the box.  While preferable to keep materials from collections together, it is not necessary. This can be done at the point of accessioning to ensure the preservation of materials that may not be fully processed quickly.

Since The Rose Library is conducting more thorough processing at the point of accession, there are two levels that will be used to arrange and describe the materials at this point: enhanced and minimal. 

* Enhanced arrangement and description:
	* If there are few items, the items should be listed out at the title level if the item is labeled. Include notable access points for researchers (e.g. names of important figures, exhibition titles or locations, or titles of media artworks).
	* If the materials are part of an obvious series (i.e. "part 1, part 2…") the items can be listed at a single level with a note about the number of items and date range.
	* If any detailed documentation of materials' content exists in the collection (e.g. transcripts, shot lists, or logs describing content), cross reference the documentation rather than describing any detailed content of the media itself in the finding aid.
	
**NOTE:** At the point of accessioning, unidentified audiovisual items can listed as an unidentified series/subseries/bolded header.

* Minimal arrangement and description:
	* Items should be removed to an AV Masters box.
	* Brief content description taken from labels on media or accompanying documentation. Just listing that the box contains audiovisual materials is not enough, and care should be taken to provide content description. 
	* Grouping related to media is sufficient if unable to verify specific content or sequence of media items.
	* Number of materials and formats should be noted.
	* Duplicate and originals will be filed together if possible.
	
* In both cases: 
	* If physical media is labeled with a lot of detail, it is not necessary to include all detail in the finding aid, containers with content written on them should be photocopied and cross referenced with the item.
	* At the point of accessioning, there is no requirement to play media to identify content. Audiovisual material with no documentation should be labeled "unidentified," and further described by physical format (e.g. "unidentified, undated [original: audio cassette]").
	* If unlabeled media is found with paper records but the relationship is unclear, it is better to leave it with those records to preserve a possible relationship; the presence of AV can be noted in a scope note for the paper component. 
	 
	 If materials are commercial recordings and will not be digitized or made available to researchers, the physical items can be removed from the collection.  However, if this is done, and the archivist should note the identity of each title with the following language: 
	
	"Researcher access is restricted due to copyright; there is no access copy. Original recording was removed from holdings"
	
	The following language should be included at the series and/or subseries level regarding the accessibility: 
	
	"Commercial recordings are not digitized and content is not available due to a risk assessment of copyright restrictions.  A list of titles are included in the inventory for researchers to identify the holdings of the creator.  These materials are available commercially and can be accessed via other sources."
	
At this time, the accessioned materials should be listed in the [Additions to the Audiovisual Inventory form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=nPsE4KSwT0K80DImBtXfOB8h8E_9r5RCthRr1wsf1axUNjFITEY4U1JVUzZDRTlCV1RGOEZBMFNCQS4u) for future digitization.  These materials will be considered backlog for digitization and the location will be noted in the [Master Shelf List](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/BoxDeletedUsers14/EZiyR14OgtROk_YUuYsg6MEBiy1izTutJ3BUfHmJM7wAxg?e=gCYaC3).

### 6.5.1.2 Processing

Audiovisual materials should be fully processed in conjunction with the paper materials of the collection, and minimal level processing should have been done at accessioning, so materials should be identified at least at that level.  It is likely that as of 2016, most collections will have not gone through the accession procedure listed above, so extra attention should be paid to those materials that have not been identified.  Regardless of the accessioning procedure followed, the following will need to be done for identification:

* If not accessioned to the standards expressed in this document (i.e. if no processing at the point of accessioning has been done), item-level (or at least subject-level) description should be completed.
* An inventory of items should be created in an Excel spreadsheet. PIDs will be added to this spreadsheet upon digitization. Columns should include AV Box Number, Item Number, Title, Date, Format.  
* If there is no identification or the labels are ambiguous, the Audiovisual Conservator should be contacted to schedule a time to play the items.  In many cases, the Audiovisual Conservator or staff will review the content as digitization is happening, and they will notify the archivist of non-archival materials for further review. 
* Sound recordings should be grouped physically with other sound recordings while video recordings should be grouped with other video.  If the total amount of audiovisual materials is less than a half linear foot, all audiovisual material should be placed in the same box.
* If a recording has extensive, detailed labeling that adds to the description, photocopy the item and cross reference it in the finding aid.  This can be done by creating folder titles or bolded headers.

To keep the Rose Library in line with current processing standards, audiovisual materials will be arranged intellectually with materials of the same subject.  For example, if there are recordings of poetry readings by the creator, those items should be listed in the series that contains other writings.  In some cases, these materials will not fall under another series value and will require their own series, for example “Interviews and Lectures.”  Series can also be expanded, so “Writings” may become “Writings and Creative Works” or “Printed material” may be expanded to “Printed and Presented works."

While it is recommended to physically keep audio and visual materials separate, they should be combined within the finding aid by intellectual content.  

Also, recordings of meetings can be arranged within an administrative record series.
If there is content of multiple subjects on a single tape (i.e. multiple presentations on a VHS tape or two distinct meetings on either side of an audiocassette), describe each intellectual item in a separate component in the finding aid and note where the item is found on the tape if known.

While we can refer to the individual cassette, film, or tape as an item, it is important to remember that, like folders, the audiovisual item holds more than just "an item." When processing, you should consider them as containers.  While a paper manuscript may be one thing, it is made up of multiple sheets and is arranged and described at the file-level, and identifying audiovisual items this way keeps us in-line with best practices. 

To identify the material within the finding aid, folder titles that include audiovisual items should end with [original: format type].  For example:

![Figure 14: Representing AV in the container list](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure14.jpg "Representing AV in the container list")

Note: Image includes a date format that is no longer used.  The approved format is Year Month Day.

There is no need for a folder number within the AV box.  In some cases, as in off-site digitization projects involving a large number of items, these item-numbers will be generated for the purpose of tracking the materials.  In this case, we will keep the numbers.  Instances where item-numbers (usually transferred to a folder number in the finding aid) should not be compiled just to have a folder number (i.e. if the number isn't needed for an external cause, we do not create this numbering system for processing). If this information is available, it can be used, but collections with small amounts of audiovisual materials, this is unnecessary.

Duplicates should be kept until material is digitized whereupon they can be considered for weeding.

**Extent:**

Within the extent, audiovisual materials should be listed as "AV Masters" and include the linear footage.  For example:

Extent: 5 linear feet (10 boxes), 25 oversized papers (OP), 2 extra oversized papers (XOP), 1 bound volume (BV), and AV Masters: 2 linear feet (1 box, 5 film canisters)

Within the parentheses, the number of boxes or items should be included.  As seen in the example above, the box count refers to the number of either Hollinger or record center boxes.  Other types of containers include film canisters and combined boxes (for example, CLP#). Within the extent, CLPs should be listed in the extent in parentheses with the number of boxes.  The container list will include the actual CLP number in the box column with a dash in the place of the folder number.  For example:

![Figure 15: Representing CLPs in the container list](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure15.jpg "Representing CLPs in the container list")

Note: Image includes a date format that is no longer used.  The approved format is Year Month Day.

Unless otherwise identified, “phonograph” is a catch-all for the various forms of recorded disks.  Care should be made to identify the type, but this will allow for enough definition until digitization.
