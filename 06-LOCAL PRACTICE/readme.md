This document provides guidance on specific arrangement and description tasks, according to local policy and practice at the Rose Library. 

When writing descriptive records for the Rose Library you should conform first and foremost to the conventions of the descriptive or bibliographic standard (DACS, MARC) that you are using.  The Emory University Communications and Public Affairs Office provides additional [style guidance](http://communications.emory.edu/resources/identity/guidelines/style-guide-editorial/index.html) for Emory publications related content and Collection Services maintains a [unit-specific style guide](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Manuals/CS%20Formatting%20and%20Style%20Guide.docx?d=w2df9086f1e054dae8759c45d7167703c&csf=1&web=1&e=jZhKev) for issues that commonly arise during description, including grammatical and spelling preferences and guidance on formulating folder titles. 

## 6.1 Original Folders

Always retain original containers and folders if they contain important or substantive writing, or if they bear a unique relationship to their contents.  Additionally, if the folders are in good shape, they may be retained as primary housing for the materials. Otherwise, folder titles and other basic information may be transcribed and the original container discarded.  If a folder or envelope is too large or bulky to fit in a standard size box, the relevant information can be photocopied and the original item can be discarded.  

## 6.2 Empty Envelopes

Retain empty postal envelopes that include return addresses.  These can be arranged at the end of a group of correspondence as "Envelopes, empty." 

## 6.3 Photographs

Archivists will use the following guidelines and their professional discretion to determine appropriate levels of arrangement and description for photographs in Rose Library collections. These guidelines are meant to offer general guidance for archivists working with photographs, though there are a few prescriptive rules.

There are many factors to consider when deciding on a processing level for photographs: context of acquisition; context of creation; fragility and conservation needs; relationship to other material in the collection; informational, evidential, and artifactual value; and presence of identifying information. Photographs are a growing collecting priority for the Rose Library and the rationale for selecting a collection is an important factor in determining processing level for photographs. At the Rose Library, we acquire photographs in three broad contexts: 1) as one part of a larger collection documenting an individual or organization; 2) collections of fine art photography by a single photographer; or 3) as part of a collection of photographs documenting a single subject and collected specifically because they are photographs. 

In collections where photographs are only one part, the photographic value of the material is usually incidental. In these cases, item level arrangement and description is almost never warranted. Photographs can be arranged and described at the file level and will mostly not be sleeved. Photographs that are attached to paper documents or part of subject files should be left in their original locations (see Restriction and Separation for additional guidance on when and how to separate photos). If photos are put at increased risk of degradation because of their proximity to newsprint or other formats in a subject file, use folder inserts to segregate the photographs. Early or rare photographic formats may require additional considerations, even in a mixed format collection. Fragile photographs should always be sleeved and stored with care.

Collections of fine art photography will likely require more item level arrangement and/or description than mixed format collections. Photographs in these collections should always be sleeved and images that are too large to be sleeved should be foldered individually. Many images will likely be foldered and described individually, but it is acceptable to folder and describe groups of photographs together when appropriate (for example, images from the same session or series). These collections may contain multiple generations of an image (i.e. negatives, contact sheets, and prints). These will likely depict slightly different versions of the image and should all be retained. Depending on size and original order, the different formats may be stored together or separately. If storing them separately, take care to describe them consistently.

Photograph collections that document a particular subject or subjects and are collected specifically because they are photographs (e.g. Langmuir) may also require more item level arrangement and/or description than a mixed format collection. These are likely to contain more early photographic formats such as glass plates and albumen prints. They are also likely to contain fewer groups of photographs with a joint provenance. Most additions will be individual items acquired from a rare book and manuscript dealer. When groups of photographs with a single provenance are acquired for addition to such a collection, these may be foldered and described together. Storage of large groups of snapshots and small format prints can be improved by first placing portions of the groups in envelopes before foldering. Two envelopes will fit in one folder. Every photograph need not be sleeved in these collections. Older formats and fragile photos should always be sleeved.

For help identifying photographic formats or guidance on processing formats not mentioned here, see [Graphics Atlas](<http://www.graphicsatlas.org/> "http://www.graphicsatlas.org/"); Mary Lynn Ritzenthaler and Diane Vogt O'Connor, Photographs: Archival Care and Management; and Sylvie Pénichon, Twentieth Century Color Photographs: Identification and Care. 

### 6.3.1 General rules:

* Wash hands before handling photographic material in any format (wearing gloves is not necessary if hands are clean)
* Handle photographic material by the edges only
* Plastic sleeves are acceptable for most photographic formats except:
	* Photos with lifting emulsions or edge frills (use paper four-flap wrappers instead to minimize surface contact)
	* Unstable materials such as cellulose nitrate or cellulose acetate negatives (use paper envelopes instead) 
	* Polaroids (use paper envelopes instead)
* When sleeving, insert photographs with the emulsion layer facing away from any seams
* Sleeve items individually regardless of format
* Photographs may never be stored in glassine; when processing, photographs must be removed from any old glassine envelopes present in the collection
* Photographs can be stored upright; oversized photographs and particularly fragile photographs should be stored flat
* Like sizes should be stored together to create even pressure in boxes; if a box contains multiple sizes and materials are slumping or bending, cardboard can be inserted between folders to create more stability (consult with preservation liaison first)
* Avoid using paperclips and plastiklips on photographs whenever possible
* Folder inserts or paper envelopes can be used to keep together a subset of photographs within a folder

### 6.3.2 Labeling photographs:

Labeling photographs should be rare. However, if you can identify the subject or subjects of the image and the photo is only one among many in a folder, writing the information lightly on the back of the photograph is an acceptable option.

* Place on a smooth, hard, flat surface; soft surfaces may cause impressions in the emulsion
* DO NOT use ink to label photographs, even supposedly archival pens marketed for photograph labeling
* Use a #2 pencil or softer or a Stabilo all graphite pencil
* Write lightly on the back of the image along the border only
* Exerting too much pressure will damage the emulsion
* Resin coated (RC) photo papers will not accept pencil; use paper or folder inserts to record any annotations
* DO NOT mark transparencies, direct positives, film negatives, or cased images
* Enclose the information in brackets to indicate it is archivist supplied information

### 6.3.3 Describing photographs: 

* Archivist devised titles should include:
	* Main subjects depicted, i.e., persons, events, activities, and objects
	* Geographical location, if known and significant
	* Date or date spans of what is being depicted 
	* Photographer, if known 
* Transcribe photographer supplied titles when describing fine art photographs (further description can be provided in a file level scope and content note if warranted)
* For images in photograph collections such as Langmuir (i.e., description is primarily item level and photographs are often unidentifiable by archivists), provide as much description for unidentified images as possible
	* For example, "Food service or domestic worker holding a kitten…"
	* Depending on the collection, you may also consider including race and gender information in the title
* Include format in the description when relevant (when describing early photographic processes or other rare formats)
* It is not necessary to include measurements/dimensions

### 6.3.4 19th Century paper prints:

* Should be sleeved
* DO NOT attempt to remove an image from its mount
* Unmounted albumen prints are prone to curling and cupping; insert an alkaline board behind the image inside the plastic sleeve to provide adequate support

### 6.3.5 Glass and metal plates:

* If uncased, store in a four-flap wrapper
* Store upright on long edge
* DO NOT store glass plates flat
* DO NOT allow to slant
* DO NOT touch the image layer
* DO NOT attempt to clean, repair, or flatten glass or metal plates
* Boxes that contain a significant number of glass plates should be marked as heavy and fragile

### 6.3.6 Color photographs:

* Color photographs are highly unstable and subject to color loss even in the dark
* Most color photographs can be stored according to the general rules above
* Polaroids should be stored in unbuffered envelopes rather than plastic (regular acid-free folders are on the high end of the appropriate pH for Polaroids; if not sleeving images individually, they should still be stored in an unbuffered envelope inside a folder)

### 6.3.7 Photograph albums:

* Photo albums should not be dismantled unless photographs have already started to release from pages
* If dismantling an album, take care to keep photographs in order using envelopes or folder inserts
* If pages have been disbound but photographs are still adhered, sleeve the individual pages and then folder or box as a unit
* Small albums that will fit in a folder may be stored in a Hollinger box or record center carton (preferably spine down)
* Larger albums should be stored flat in a box no more than one inch larger than the album on either side (see Head of Collection Processing to order boxes that will fit if none are on hand)

### 6.3.8 Slides and transparencies:

* Slide is usually the original negative
* Store in plastic slide pages
* If collection contains a significant number of slides, acid free three-ring binder boxes can be used for permanent storage

### 6.3.9 Negatives:

* Negatives can be sleeved in plastic
* Follow the general guidance for deciding to sleeve photographs when deciding whether or not to sleeve negatives

### 6.3.10 Nitrate film:

* Should be stored at temps below 50 with a RH of 30-40% at minimum
* Should always be stored in paper to prevent build-up of unstable gasses

### 6.3.11 Cellulose acetate film:

* Cellulose acetates shrink as they age and display vinegar syndrome
* Cellulose acetates should also be stored in alkaline buffered paper envelopes or sleeves and placed in cold storage
  

## 6.4 Newspaper Clippings

Newspaper clippings should be appraised for their relevancy to a collection and only those that are about the creator or their work should be kept.  Clippings are commonly available outside the archives and should never be arranged or described in detail.  They can be described as "Clippings, [date range]" and be boxed or foldered without sorting.  Preservation photocopies should not be made, nor should clippings be unfolded to create oversized papers (OP).  Weed duplicates if they're obvious, but do not waste time trying to identify duplicates. 

## 6.5 Audiovisual Material

Audiovisual materials can be described separately by format or intellectually with other records by function.  Physically, sound and video recordings should be housed in audiovisual (AV) masters boxes.  For preservation purposes, sound and video recordings should be housed separately when possible.  When working with a small amount of recordings, everything can be housed together in one box. For additional information about AV workflows see [Processing guidelines for audiovisual materials](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/blob/master/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/processing-guidelines-for-audiovisual-materials.md). 

## 6.6 Housing and Storage

### 6.6.1 Folders

Use legal-size folders as the default and do not overstuff folders. See the [preservation chapter](/9-PRESERVATION/readme.md) for additional information on proper foldering.

Folders should be labeled with the following information: 

* Abbreviated form of the collection title (usually the creator's last name or an abbreviation of the organization's name);
* Collection number;
* Series/subseries title, if applicable;
* Bolded header, if applicable;
* Box number;
* Folder number;
* When adding folders to artificial (miscellaneous) collections or when interfiling a small number of folders in existing collections (additions), also add the accession number to the left corner of the front flap.

![Figure 1: Folder labeling](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure1.jpg "Folder labeling")

Separate the collection title and manuscript number, series and subseries titles, and box and folder numbers with a slash.  The box number always precedes the folder number.  When using bolded headers, they should be followed by a colon before writing the folder title.  Separate segments of the folder title with commas. 

### 6.6.2 Boxing Collections

Processed collections should be placed into acid-neutral, archival containers.  In the Rose, we primarily house collection in Hollinger document cases or Paige Miracle boxes.  These boxes are expensive and should not be used for temporary storage projects in cases where the boxes will be broken back down at the end of a project.

Folders should be placed within the box with enough room that the archivist's fingers just reach the bottom. The box should be full enough that folders do not slouch, but not so full that folders cannot be removed easily. If a box is properly packed, a single folder can be partially lifted from the box and not fall back down.  Spacers should be used when there are not enough folders to fill a box properly (usually necessary in the last box of paper materials in a collection). If materials have been removed for preservation or exhibition, space should be held for those materials.  

**Audiovisual materials** should be removed from the general holdings and placed in boxes labeled "AV." Ideally, sound recordings should be separated from video recordings, but if there is only a small amount in the collection (less than one box), they can be housed together. Phonographs, because of their size, often do not fit on regular sized shelves and are housed on the LP shelves in the Nunnery. In the case that there are not enough LPs from one collection to fill a phonograph box, they may be housed in one of the combined LP (CLP) boxes. 

**Oversized materials**

*Preferred* For collections that are or will be primarily stored at the LSC: Any material larger than 8.5" x 14" but smaller than 20" x 24" (i.e., can fit in a standard box the Rose Library purchases) should be given **regular box and folder numbers** in sequence with material stored in Hollinger document cases and record center cartons. Documents and photographs larger than 20" x 24" and up to 24" x 36" should be given an OP (oversized papers) number to indicate that it is being stored onsite on Level 11 in the Abbey. Materials larger than that will be given an XOP (extra-oversized papers) number to indicate that it is being stored onsite on Level 11 in the Nunnery. The LSC will accept boxes up to 20" x 24," and boxes sent to the LSC should be given regular box numbers rather than OP numbers since OP references a shelving location. Due to space constraints in oversized material shelving in the Abbey and the Nunnery, newly accessioned or processed oversized material should be sent to the LSC when possible.

For collections that are or will be primarily stored onsite: Documents and photographs larger than 8.5" x 14" should be given **oversized papers (OP)** numbers to indicate that they are being shelved onsite on Level 11 in the Abbey. These materials should be housed in oversized folders within oversized boxes. There are two sizes of oversized boxes: 16" x 20" and 20"x24". Items that are too large to fit in a box, but are not longer than 36" can be placed in large folders, given OP numbers, and stored on the OP shelves in the Abbey without a box. Materials larger than that should be given **extra-oversized papers (XOP)** numbers and are shelved in folders in the Nunnery.

When possible, **framed items** such as photographs, certificates, or artwork, should be unframed and stored according to the size of the item. If it is not possible to remove the frame, the item can be secured with pH buffered paper or bubble wrap and housed in an oversized box. In this case, it should be described in the finding aid according to the instructions above regarding oversized materials. Framed items that cannot be boxed should be labeled and hung on the 11th floor art racks. Describe these items in the finding aid as framed items (FR). Do not affix labels to the frames themselves. Print a small (4" x 2") label, affix the label to a strip of acid free card stock, punch a hole in the top, and tie the label to the hanger on the frame. If the frame does not have hanging hardware on the back, consult with the preservation liaison. Do not add any framed items to the art racks without first identifying and labeling them appropriately. 

**Bound volumes (BV)** and **oversized bound volumes (OBV)** are usually ledgers, scrapbooks, photograph albums, or other bound items.  Bound items that will fit in Hollinger document case should be placed in folders and stored as normal. Bound items that will fit in boxes up to 20" x 24" and are part of collections that are or will be stored primarily at the LSC should be stored as normal and the boxes given regular box numbers. Bound items that are part of collections that are or will be stored onsite and are too large to reside with the rest of collection should be boxed separately and identified in the finding aid as BVs or OBVs. When boxing multiple items together, insert a strip of acid-free card stock into each item identifying it. Bound items that are part of collections that are or will be stored at the LSC and are too large for a 20 x 24" box should be identified with a strip of acid-free card stock, identified as an OBV in the finding aid, and placed on appropriate shelving onsite.

**OP, XOP, BV, and OBV numbering** is similar to numbering regular size boxes and folders. Boxes for bound and oversized material **staying onsite** are numbered sequentially with OP, BV, or OBV preceding the numeral. For example, OP1, OP2, BV1, OBV1, etc. Folders or bound items within the boxes are also numbered sequentially in the same fashion as regular size folders. For example, OP1/1, OP1/2, BV1/1, etc. External housing should be labeled with a printed label (see below). Within boxes, folders and items may be labeled by hand. Folders going directly on shelves (e.g., 24" x 36" OP folders or 36" x 48" XOP folders) should have a printed label placed in the bottom lefthand corner of the folder opening. *Note: Oversized and bound material going to the LSC should receive regular box and folder numbers.*

**Box labels** should include the following information (see figure 2 for an example): 

* Emory University;
* Rose Library;
* Manuscript or EUA number;
* Main entry (dates do not have to be included and should not be included if they're subject to change, i.e. if the person is still living); 
* Collection title (do not include the date range in the title statement since it will change in the event of accruals);
* Box number.

![Figure 2: Box labeling](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure2.jpg "Box labeling")

*Figure 2*


There are three sizes for labels. The most commonly used is the [4" x 3 1/3" labels](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Manuscript%20Box%20Labels/MSSlabels%20101-200.doc?d=w22bbbb9e7367446a8b9f668b968c1827&csf=1&web=1&e=zxIl64). These are used for record center boxes and Hollinger boxes.  Smaller labels measuring [4" x 2"](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Manuscript%20Box%20Labels/MSSlabels%20[small]%201-100.doc?d=w33190c2d0c574d44a4ce8d245a1ebf84&csf=1&web=1&e=NYu0hh) are used for the half Hollinger boxes as well as the OP boxes.  There is an [additional template for the 4" x 2" labels](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Manuscript%20Box%20Labels/MSSlabels%20[1.5%20depth%20boxes].doc?d=w894f959bdda44618866d3fb30162f097&csf=1&web=1&e=7SKAx4), specifically formatted for OP boxes measuring 1.5" in depth. 


Restricted material and material that has mold must be housed separately from the rest of the collection.  Restricted material should be boxed in a way that facilitates providing access to the material once the restrictions have expired.  For example, if there are multiple levels of restriction in a collection, box materials subject to the same restrictions together.  When the restrictions expire, the box can simply be relabled and folders within redescribed as accessible in the finding aid.   

**Examples:**

*Hollinger box (.5 linear feet):* Label should be placed in the middle, under the flap. The barcode should be placed on the middle of the bottom of the flap.

![Figure 3: Regular Hollinger box](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure3.jpg "Regular Hollinger box")

*Half Hollinger box (.25 linear feet):* Label should be placed in the middle, under the flap. The barcode should be placed on the middle of the bottom of the flap.

![Figure 4: Half Hollinger box](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure4.jpg "Half Hollinger box")

*Record center box (1 linear foot):* Label should be placed in the middle, under the handle with enough room to place the barcode between the handle and the label. 

![Figure 5: Record center box](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure5.jpg "Record center box")

*Oversized papers box (also applies to bound and oversized bound volume boxes):* Label should be placed on the left side of the front of the box. The barcode should be placed to the right of the label. 

![Figure 6: Oversized papers box](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure6.jpg "Oversized papers box")

Boxes that contain **moldy material** should be labeled with two brightly colored alert labels: "Mold Alert," and "Researcher Alert."  These should be placed on the box so that the "Mold Alert" label faces out on the shelf and the "Researcher Alert" label is visible to patrons when the boxes are in use. Oversized boxes may not always have enough space on the front for one or both labels. In this case, put the labels in a logical place on the front and/or top of the box so they are visible to staff and patrons. You can use scotch tape to affix the labels to the boxes but make sure the labels are taped on at least two sides and not in danger of being ripped off by frequent use. See figures 7-9 for examples.

### 6.6.3 Restricted Material

Materials deemed restricted should be physically isolated in a separate box. The box should be clearly stamped with the RESTRICTED stamp to avoid any unauthorized access (see figure 10). 

![Figure 10: Restricted material](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure10.jpg "Restricted material")

*Figure 10*

There may additionally be restrictions on how patrons may use material, such as **prohibitions on photography** or **reproduction restrictions** that are also indicated by a stamp on the label. See figures 11-13 for examples.

![Figure 11: No personal photography](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure11.jpg "No personal photography")

*Figure 11: No personal photography*

![Figure 12: Reproduction restrictions](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure12.jpg "Reproduction restrictions")

*Figure 12: Reproduction restrictions, used primarily for boxes that contain sheet music or scores. When affixing this label to boxes, you may place the label higher on the flap to accommodate barcodes.*

![Figure 13: No camera](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure13.jpg "No camera")

*Figure 13: When the restriction only applies to one or a few folders in the box, also stamp the folders with the "no camera" stamp as a visual cue for patrons and staff.*
