## 14.1 Project management

## 14.1.1 Team Processing
At the end of each fiscal year, the Head of Collections Services, in consultation with the Rose Library Leadership Team, determines priorities for in-depth processing projects for the upcoming year. They base their decisions on use in the reading room, curatorial priority, input from the Collection Services Unit, and conservation needs. The Head of Collection Services assigns projects to each processing team, consisting of a Manuscript Archivist and two or more graduate student assistants.

The Manuscript Archivist leads the team, creates a work plan, sets goals, and directs student work. Each team member is assigned portions of the collection to process based on the work plan. This includes physical arrangement and foldering as well as description such as scope and content and biographical/historical notes. The Manuscript Archivist works closely with the students to ensure that the collections are being processed according to professional standards. The Manuscript Archivist is responsible for the arrangement plan, but processing students should feel confident to discuss other options and ideas with the Manuscript Archivist. As students work through their assignments, they may discover information or records that will alter the original arrangement plan. It is important to share such information so appropriate decisions can be made. Since each team member is responsible for discreet sections of the collection, communication is key to ensuring that relationships between sections are maintained and well described.

The Manuscript Archivist generally is responsible for compiling the component level descriptions into a finding aid and creating the collection level description. However, as processing students gain more experience, the Manuscript Archivist may delegate some or all of this work. The Manuscript Archivist reviews the portions of the finding aids for which the processing students are responsible. The Archivist should share any changes or corrections with the students, particularly if these affect the physical arrangement of folders within the collection. When the finding aid is complete, the Manuscript Archivist will send it to other archivists and the curator responsible for acquiring the collection (See 5.3 Reviewing and Encoding Finding Aids for additional information).

### 14.1.2 Work Plans
Work plans are the blueprints for processing a collection. The work plan outlines the arrangement of a collection, identifies a collection's preservation needs, and recommends appraisal and weeding actions. The work plan also includes estimates of the time needed to process the collection and processing assignments for each component. The work plan will also contain information found in the collection file, including restrictions placed on the materials and important information about the creator or the custodial history of the collection that may affect processing. As processing proceeds, team members will record decisions and changes that alter or add complexity to the original plan. The work plan is a living document for the duration of the project and is not considered complete until the project is finished. The work plan template is available here.

Much of the content of the work plan will come from the collection analysis. When the plan is complete, the Manuscript Archivist will share the document with the Head of Collection Services and the curator responsible for acquiring the collection. Each party may make suggestions or ask questions about elements of the plan. At this point, it may be necessary to schedule a face to face conversation with the curator to discuss strategy or ask/answer questions. Curators often have important information about collection creators that can influence archival processing decisions. If that conversation has not already happened, review of the work plan is a good time to ensure all relevant information has been shared.

The Manuscript Archivist should review approved work plans with their processing team. Though it is likely that the students are already well aware of the arrangement plans from their involvement in the collection assessment and preliminary sorting, notify them of any changes and confirm that they are aware of and understand their assignments.

When the processing project is complete and all updates have been made to the work plan, file it in the permanent collection file (CL-2).

### 14.1.3 Asana
Asana is the project management program that Collection Services uses to track processing projects. Projects can be divided into task lists and each task can be assigned to individual team members. Asana will send reminders about approaching deadlines to whoever is assigned a particular task. Asana also allows team members to communicate via comments on tasks. This program also offers a calendar view that allows team members to see deadlines in relation to other unit projects. When a task is marked complete, a rainbow unicorn or other mythical creature will fly across the computer screen to celebrate. Staff can use Asana to track other projects as well.

### 14.1.4 Clockify
[This section needs to be updated]

## 14.2 Workplace and Environment

### 14.2.1 Training
Approaches to training for students and new professional staff will vary. Students need introductions to both basic archival principles and local practices, while new professional staff may only need orientation to local practice. Training for new staff may also include training in advanced concepts relating to cataloging and systems. All training is iterative and will occur as new skills become necessary.

### 14.2.1.1 Students
Create an orientation packet for a new student's first day. Include:

* Rose and Woodruff Libraries orientation materials:
	* Rose Library promotional material
	* Rose Library welcome and rules
	* LITS Student Employee Handbook
	* Emergency procedures
	* Student attendance policy
	* Collection Services manual
* Professional readings [for manuscript and archival processing assistants only]:
	* Roe, Kathleen D., Arranging and Describing Archives and Manuscripts, Society of American Archivists, 2005. Chapters 1, 2 and 4.
	* O'Toole, James M. and Richard Cox, Understanding Archives and Manuscripts, Society of American Archivists, 2006. Chapters 3 and 4 (including chapter 2 for an optional historical perspective).
Society of American Archivists Core Values and Code of Ethics.

On the first day, the supervisor should review the library orientation material with the student(s). It is especially important during this review to talk in detail about the Rose Library welcome and rules document and to set any additional expectations for student behavior. Emphasize that many of these rules, such as not allowing bags or food on the 9th floor, are for security and preservation of the materials. If there are additional rules and expectations for working on your team, make these clear during this meeting. For example, whether or not students may carry their phones with them or what kinds of media they can consume while working. Also be sure to review the LITS student handbook to ensure the student(s) know how to clock in and out and that they are aware of wider library rules that may differ from those of the Rose Library. Give the student a tour of the Rose Library, including the 11th floor, and test the student(s)' prox card for access to secure work spaces.

When training graduate processing assistants, following the tour and review of orientation material, give the student(s) time to read the Collection Services manual and the professional readings you've included in the packet. This may take a significant portion of their first two shifts. Encourage them to read the materials closely and reassure them that it's okay to take their time. When they've finished reading, discuss any questions they have and take some time to talk in depth about archival principles and the goals of arrangement and description.

It's helpful at this point to remind them that they aren't expected to memorize everything on the first day and that you'll work closely with them to teach new skills as they become necessary. Remind the student(s) also to keep their copy of the policy and procedures manual and refer to it when they have questions. If possible, plan to work alongside students regularly for their first few months. Completing tasks together improves the learning process for new students. Additionally, being in close proximity to answer questions as they arise and to model good practice minimizes student mistakes.

### 14.2.1.2 New Staff
In advance of a new staff person starting work, review the Rose Library onboarding checklist and new staff handbook.

New professional staff will have the benefit of graduate training in library and/or archival theory, and may also have prior professional experience. It won't be necessary to spend a lot of time reviewing basic practice with them. However, it is important to gauge their experience and knowledge and plan training accordingly. Most training will be focused on local practice and ensuring the new staff person's performance meets expectations for consistency, clarity, attention to detail, and problem solving. Set expectations early and continue to reinforce training as the person gains proficiency. Remember that the nature of special collections work means that training will occur over a period of months, not weeks.

General tips:

* Create training schedule for first week or two to create structure and ease transition;
* Have new staff person shadow other staff when learning new tasks;
* Rely on staff who are experts in various topics to lead training in those areas.

### 14.2.2 Self-Care During Processing
Self-care at work is important. Our work requires a lot of physical activity such as lifting and carrying heavy boxes that, if done improperly, can lead to injury. Additionally, we are often asked to work with historical materials documenting difficult or triggering events and topics. Protecting ourselves physically and mentally is a crucial element of maintaining productivity and remaining good stewards of our collections. It is important to pay attention to your body; only you will know when something doesn't feel right and you need a break. Always talk to your supervisor if there is a problem or if you have concerns about something in the workplace. We can address problems or provide you with resources that can help.

### 14.2.2.1 Physical Care
The average records center carton containing books or archival material weighs approximately 40-50 pounds. It's common for boxes to weigh much more, depending on the contents, or to be especially large or awkwardly shaped. Lifting boxes improperly or removing them from shelves/carts improperly can lead to back or neck injuries and pulled muscles.

Guidelines for Lifting:

* Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart
* Bend your knees and squat down to the box
* Grasp the box firmly and hold it close to your body
* Keeping your back straight and your shoulders back, slowly stand up, pushing with your legs
* Change direction with your feet and hips to move forward
* Follow these steps to return the box
* DO NOT bend forward at the waist and lift
* DO NOT lift a box above your shoulders
* Avoid twisting and turning at the waist while lifting
* If the box is too heavy to manage on your own, ask for help from a colleague or your supervisor

See http://www.webmd.com/back-pain/proper-lifting-technique for additional guidance.

Guidelines for Removing Boxes from the Shelf:

* To remove boxes from high shelves, use a step stool or library ladder
* Make sure the stool or ladder is stable before climbing
* You should be chest-level with the box before attempting to remove it
* Grasp the box handle firmly and slide it toward you, supporting the bottom of the box
* Hold the box close to your body and carefully descend the stool or ladder
* If the box is difficult to reach, as for help from a colleague
* DO NOT remove boxes from shelves above your head by reaching
* To remove boxes from low shelves, follow the instructions for proper lifting

Guidelines for Moving Boxes:

* Use a cart to move records center cartons, large boxes/items, or heavy boxes
* DO NOT carry more than one box at a time
* DO NOT carry boxes for long periods of time
* DO NOT carry boxes up or down stairs

Much of the work of processing requires sitting for long periods of time and can lead to muscle fatigue and other ergonomic injuries. Maintaining good posture while working and taking breaks to stretch can alleviate these problems. While sitting, be sure your chair is positioned so that you're working with your elbows at a 90-degree angle, your thighs parallel to the floor, and your feet flat on the floor. The top of your computer monitor should be at or slightly below eye level. The chairs have adjustable lumbar supports for your lower back.

See http://ergonomics.ucr.edu/signs_symptoms.html for more information.

For every four hours worked, take a 15-minute break to stand up, walk around, and stretch. Do this at the two-hour mark. If this is not adequate, spend a few minutes stretching each hour. There are examples online of stretches you can do to avoid injuries caused by poor posture, sitting for long periods, and repetitive activities. If there are tasks you can do while standing, such as sorting materials, you should feel free to do so.

Archival collections frequently arrive at the archives dirty from age and/or poor storage environments. Dirt and dust can aggravate allergies causing runny nose, cough, and itchy eyes. As archivists we must also occasionally work with hazardous materials such as mold. Mold inhalation can cause serious illness so it is especially important to protect yourself. Your supervisor can provide you with protective gear.

* Wash your hands frequently
* Wear gloves
* Wear an apron (be sure to wash your clothes when you get home)
* Wear an N-95 respirator
* Clean your workspace with Clorox wipes when finished
* Further training can be provided by Conservation staff if necessary

There are other tips and general guidelines for physical self-care while working in archives:
* Take plenty of water breaks to stay hydrated. Archives tend to be dry and dehydration can exacerbate issues such as muscle soreness. There is a water fountain on each floor. You may also bring a water bottle to the 9th floor, but it must be kept in the staff cubicle area of the floor. Water is not allowed in the processing pods.
* Closed-toe shoes are recommended, especially when working on projects that involve a significant amount of box moving.

### 14.2.2.2 Emotional Care
Stress, pressure, moments of exhaustion and fatigue, conflict, and frustration are all natural parts of any work environment. Working with archival materials also can be mentally and emotionally draining due to difficulty of subject matter, complexity of the collection and required work, or the tedium of rote tasks such as unfolding tri-fold documents or item-level organization. There is no way to eliminate these things from our work lives, but there are many strategies to cope with and reduce the stress and fatigue caused by our work:

* Create and maintain healthy daily habits.
* Take breaks. You are encouraged to take regular breaks during your shift, but additional breaks are acceptable if you feel overwhelmed by a collection. Collections such as the Neighbor's Network records and the Langmuir photograph collection have been particularly triggering for staff and students. Physical distance can help create emotional distance when working with such material.
* Set and enforce healthy professional boundaries. Avoid work activity such as checking email outside of business hours (though some exceptions may occasionally arise). Identify ways to create privacy in the open floor plan office setting when necessary.
* Use techniques such as mindfulness meditation to manage stress. Take advantage of services offered by the library such as the coloring station in the first floor staff break room or attend mindfulness group meetings.
* Talk with your colleagues or supervisor. Verbally processing feelings can help reduce frustration. Your supervisor can also help formulate a plan and/or identify resources for addressing conflict or other issues that arise.
* Listen to your favorite music. Headphones and phones/iPods are allowed in workspaces, but talk with your supervisor if there are questions about permissible media.
* Adjust your work schedule. Work/life balance is important and temporary or permanent changes to your schedule can help recalibrate this balance.
* Many of the strategies for physical self-care, such as physical activity throughout the day and staying well-hydrated, also promote emotional self-care.

Office supplies, bond paper, and box labels are located in the 9th floor copy room. Additional supplies are stored in the Collection Transition Room on the 10th floor or in the 2nd floor mail room. To access the supplies in the mail room, speak with mail room and/or facilities staff who can locate and retrieve what you need.

## 14.3 Supplies

### 14.3.1 Office Supplies
To order office supplies:

* Office supplies must be ordered through Staples.
* To order supplies, send Moffett Morris a list of the item(s) you need. Include links to the item(s) from the Staples website.

### 14.3.2 Archival Supplies
To order archival supplies:

* Send a list of the item(s) and quantity you need to the appropriate Collection Services staff person.
* When preparing to rebox a manuscript collection, request a new supply of Hollinger boxes as early as you can to avoid depleting the supply of boxes on hand. Most orders arrive within one to two weeks. Hollinger will expedite shipping if their supply can accommodate a rush order, but this should be rare.
* If you notice that the supply of an item normally kept on hand is low or has been used up, notify the Collection Services staff person and they will replenish the stock.
* The Collection Services staff person will submit orders to the appropriate vendor, typically via email.
	* To order from Hollinger Metal Edge, email Pam Hamilton directly at pam@metaledgeinc.com. Include the item number, item description, and quantity needed in the email. Hollinger will send an invoice to be paid and the Collection Services staff person will submit for payment via Service Now.
	* Order Paige miracle boxes directly from the Paige Company at 800-223-1901 using your coroporate card. Should you need to order boxes to be delivered to multiple addresses, order directly from James (Jim) Mikedes at JMikedes@paigecompany.com or 800-223-1901 x144.
* The Collection Services staff person in charge of supplies tracks items in a spreadsheet on OneDrive. At the end of each fiscal year, they tally the total annual supply expenditure and add it to the first worksheet of the spreadsheet.
* When orders arrive, move them from the Level 2 mailroom to Level 9 in a timely fashion, calling on help from others available. Label them clearly and put them away in the archival supply storage area.

### 14.3.3 Shipping Supplies
To order shipping supplies:

* Go to uline.com.
* Sign in with account.
* Add needed items to Cart either via Order History or through browsing:
	* Standard box size is 15x12x10 and the model # is S-4153 (set of 25 each);
	* Standard tape is model #S-10173 (sold in sets of 12).
* Click checkout.
* Click "Ship to this Address" if the donor/seller's address appears or click "+Add New Address" if we have not previously shipped to them.
* Enter information and select business or residential. Click continue.
* Shipping should be set at UPS Ground. Click continue.
* Select "Bill me (net 30 account)" Click continue.
* If we have not shipped to the destination state before, you will receive an error message about tax exemption in blue on the screen. If this happens, contact the Director of Finance and Business Planning for the libraries to complete tax exemption certification for that state before completing the order.
* Verify all of the information for the order and then click "Submit Order."
* You will receive a confirmation email - please forward this to the Administrative Assistant so that they know to process payment to ULINE.

### 14.3.4 Barcodes
To order barcodes:

* Email Yvette Wright (libypw@emory.edu), who coordinates the barcodes for the Libraries) to alert her that we will be ordering barcodes. She will respond with the first barcode number that we should request when we put in our order.
* Send a request to Library Finance via Service Now with the following information:
	* Number of barcodes to be ordered (10,000 is common, but not mandated);
	* Vendor information (Vernon Library Supplies);
	* Font: Kumdure;
	* The first barcode number (which you have received from Anna);
	* The SpeedType to use;
	* A sample of the barcodes (scan one sheet of unused barcodes from a package, make sure the barcodes read Rose Library at the top of the label).

### 14.3.5 Paying for Supplies using Service Now
* If you paid for supplies using your corporate card, complete a LITS Travel and Expense Report for reimbursement.
* If you have an invoice, submit to Library Finance using the LITS Invoice or Quote Processing Request form:
	* Select "Pay Invoice with no PO Number" from the drop down menu;
	* Fill out each required field in the form (Note: Vendor should not be new);
	* Supply as much information as possible in the field, "Provide a brief description of what you are trying to do";
	* Attach PDF copy of invoice before submitting.

## 14.1 Packing guidelines

Collection Services staff occasionally travel to a donor/seller (generally with the collecting curator) to assist in packing collections for transfer to the Rose. This will involve packing all desired material into standard sized boxes provided by the Rose and attaching shipping labels as appropriate. After the packing is complete, the Accessioning Archivist will arrange for the move of the material (generally via FedEx).  If there are any particularly fragile or valuable items, those should be hand-carried by the archivist rather than shipped.  If this situation should arise, consult with the Head of Collection Services to determine a plan of action.

When a curator requests packing assistance: 

* The curator will contact the Head of Collection Services with details of the trip, including the proposed dates and location. 
* The Head of Collection Services will communicate this information to the Collection Services team for volunteers to join the curator. 
* Traveling parties will coordinate together in terms of booking flights, hotels, etc. with the curator being the primary coordinator of the trip. 

Participating in packing gives Collection Services the opportunity to gather preliminary information about a collection, such as how material is arranged and used on-site.  Collection Services staff should take notes on the original order and use patterns, and photograph the space in which the records were used and kept whenever possible. Retain as many notes about collection material and decisions made on-site as possible while remaining efficient during the packing process. At this point, the packing team learns more information about the collection than anyone else and must be able to transfer the knowledge they gain on the trip to the accessioning team when they return to the library. 

Staff should follow these packing guidelines when packing a collection for transfer to the Rose.  


### 14.1.1 Physical Handling

Make sure that all boxes used for transfer purposes are in good condition. The method of shipping and transfer may affect the kind of box used for packing. Local transfers may use bankers boxes with lids; however when shipping via FedEx or similar carrier, shipping boxes must be used. It is important that the boxes are within the following dimensions whenever possible so that we can shelve them while they await accessioning:

|        | Measurement            |
|--------|------------------------|
| Width  | 12 inches              |
| Length | 15 inches              |
| Height | 10.5 inches            |
| Weight | No more than 30 pounds |

Remove or mark out any old labels or markings. Ensure the boxes are stable and secure. This usually requires a double row of tape along the top and bottom seams and around the edges of the box.  Secure the center seams of bottom of each box with a double row of tape.  You do not need to tape down lids on banker's boxes being moved locally.

Files should be transferred to packing boxes in the order in which they have been stored (if there is one). Files should be packed so that they are standing upright in the boxes. To maintain original order and the context of creation and use, do not place any folders perpendicular to the main body of folders down the sides of the box or flat across the tops of the folders in the box.  It may not be clear to us later where those stray folders fit into the sequence of files.

If loose folder labels fall off during file transfer, make sure they are placed inside the folder they describe.

Boxes should be packed tightly enough that the files do not slump or shift, but should not be overstuffed. If the records do not fill the box, add crumpled paper, bubble wrap, or cardboard to keep the records upright and to prevent their contents from falling out and becoming mixed together during transit.  

If you finish packing a file drawer, category of record, or record location and there is still room in a box for more material, place a divider in the box to indicate the transition.

Place the preprinted label on the top side of each box. Each preprinted label comes in two parts: a top, thin part that has the tracking number for that label and then the actual label itself. Please retain the thin piece with the tracking number and provide those numbers to the Accessioning Archivist.

**Identification of records while packing:**

While packing, keep a running list of the general contents of each box and make sure to number the outside of the boxes with a marker on both the long and short end of the box (not the top of the box).

For example:

| Date: mm/dd/yyyy       |
|------------------------|
| List by: [name]        |
|                        |
| John Smith, Sr. papers |

| Box | Contents                             |
|-----|--------------------------------------|
| 1   | Business correspondence, 1950s-1960s |
| 2   | Business correspondence, 1950s-1960s |
| 3   | Business correspondence, 1950s-1960s |
| 4   | Scrapbooks, 1930s?                   |
| 5   | Awards received                      |
| 6   | Family photographs, 1940s?-1980s     |
| 7   | Family correspondence, 1940s?-1980s  |

If a collection includes born-digital files stored on the donor's current computer, the curator should notify the Head of Collection Services and the Digital Archivist at least two weeks in advance of any packing trip in order to allow time to plan and gather information and fill out the Born Digital Acquisitions [content](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/Born%20Digital%20Acquisitions%20Documents/Born-Digital_survey.docx?d=wcccb3b8e8603434b9f77f69aa3d405b9&csf=1&web=1&e=2I5cNF) and [technical](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Digital%20Collections/Forms,%20Surveys,%20and%20Handouts/BD_technicalSurvey.docx?d=w82829536ed7f4d64b460cad6dbd06bc0&csf=1&web=1&e=Oy0E7f) surveys.

Collection Services members should submit a report of all packing trips to the Head of Collection Services to be shared with the accessioning team. The report will include the container list made while on site, a general report of the physical space and how the records were created and used, and a high level collection analysis indicating potential series, along with any photographs they took of the collection before and during packing.  

### 14.1.2 Packing Supplies

The Accessioning Archivist will arrange to have shipping and other needed supplies sent to the packing location in advance of the packing trip (see [13.3 Shipping supplies](/13-SUPPLIES#133-shipping-supplies)), as well as request shipping labels for the travelers. 

Collection Services also maintains a packing supplies bag that should accompany staff on packing trips (nota bene: if flying, this bag must travel in checked luggage). This bag contains: 

* Box cutters and scissors;
* Screwdrivers, pliers, and wire cutters;
* Packing tape;
* Tape dispenser;
* Sharpies, pens, and pencils;
* Notebooks.

Review the contents of the bag two weeks prior to the trip, and identify items that need to be restocked. If you run out of supplies during the trip, purchase what you need on your corporate credit card (see [13.1 Office supplies](/13-SUPPLIES#131-office-supplies)).		

Supplies needed for the transfer of born-digital files from current computers may include:

* External hard drives and flash drives;
* Write blockers;
* Screwdrivers;
* The Digital Archives transfer laptop.

The Digital Archivist will be responsible for packing a bag with the necessary tools and equipment. This should be taken as a carry-on item due to fluctuating temperatures in the cargo hold and the potentially fragile nature of the devices. 

## 14.2 Moving and Shipping Collections

### 14.2.1 Local Collections

Collections in the Atlanta area are transferred to the library in one of two ways: 

* Emory staff move material ourselves;
* We hire a local moving company to move the collection to the Rose.

For either of these options the collection should be boxed in shelf-ready boxes and labeled. The Accessioning Archivist should be given as much notice as possible in order to arrange a supply order and stacks space for the material. 

**Emory staff moves materials:**

The most expeditious way to move small, local collections is often to have Rose staff transfer the material. Curators or Collection Services staff can: 

* Rent a car or van through Emory’s [local vehicle rental](https://www.finance.emory.edu/home/Procure%20and%20Pay/how_to_buy_in_the_marketplace/index_procure_pay_vehicle_limo_rental.html); 
* Use a personal vehicle to travel to pack the collection and submit for mileage reimbursement.

**Hiring local movers:**

The Rose Library currently contracts Flood Brothers movers to coordinate local moves. Both Flood Brothers and the Accessioning Archivist need at least two weeks’ notice to coordinate the move. Our contact at Flood Brothers is Barry Stewart ( ph.:404-799-3744 ext. 325; email: barry.stewart@floodbrothers.net).

To plan a local move the Accessioning Archivist needs to know: 

* Pick up address(es);
* Donor contact information;
* Number of boxes;
* Preferred date and time for the move;
* Any other information about the physical space (such as if the move will involve stairs, if there is parking at the pickup location, etc.). 

### 14.2.2 Shipping

Emory University contracts with FedEx when shipping collections. Processes differ between domestic and international shipping methods.

FedEx can pick up collections from donors' homes except in the following situations: 

* When material is too large for the standard boxes sent to the packing location. The packing team should take them to a FedEx location to be securely packed and shipped to the Rose Library using the FedEx account number. 
* When material is too fragile or when the only material gathered are born-digital files transferred to digital media, for example, a flash drive or external hard drive. In both instances, the packing team should plan to bring these materials back with them as carry-on items. 
* For international shipments, it is far preferable to drop packages off at a FedEx location, however, a FedEx pickup may still be arranged for international shipments if drop off is not an option.

### 14.2.2.1 Shipping supplies

The Rose recommends that collections are packed in boxes that we supply because we know that these boxes will fit on our shelves. Whether the donor/seller is packing the collection themselves or Rose Library staff is traveling to pack the collection, please send an appropriate amount of boxes and tape to the packing location. In the case of book collections, sometimes additional material may be needed, such as newsprint for cushion. Rose Library staff should refer to the packing instructions above. If donors/sellers are doing the packing, they should be provided with the [packing instructions for donors](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/Packing%20instructions%20for%20donors%20shipping%20via%20FedEx.docx?d=w220c3220f3094b58938b27df8e17d4d1&csf=1&web=1&e=M3Iv30), and curators should consult with them thoroughly about what material should be sent.

If shipping supplies are needed, please contact the Accessioning Archivist with:

* Number of boxes (sold in packs of 25);
* Amount of packing tape (sold in packs of 12 rolls);
* Any other supplies needed.

Typically, a good ratio is one pack of tape (12 rolls) per pack of boxes (25 boxes). Please also provide the shipping address and contact information for a recipient at the location, including name and phone number. Please allow 3 business days from point of order for supplies to arrive to the destination.

### 14.2.2.2 Domestic shipping 

Rose Library staff is responsible for procuring prepaid FedEx labels and providing them to the necessary parties. The Accessioning Archivist will email the Library Mail Clerk to request labels or the Facilities & Multimedia Assistant, if the Library Mail Clerk is out of the office. The email should include the return address (meaning the address where it is being picked up) with contact name and phone number and the approximate amount of boxes. All shipping labels should be addressed to the Accessioning Archivist. Labels may either be mailed to the donor/seller or carried by the Rose Library staff person traveling to pack a collection. The Library Mail Clerk will mail the labels, if needed.

Once a collection is packed, the boxes will either need to be taken to a FedEx location or the Accessioning Archivist will need to schedule a FedEx pickup. Some things to note:

* FedEx pickups require 48 hours’ notice from the first hour of the desired eight hour pickup window. 
* An adult over the age of 18 must be present in order for FedEx to pick up. 
* FedEx will not offer or guarantee a call prior to arrival. 
* FedEx policy is to not enter residences; they ask that boxes be left in an accessible area. However, they have been known to enter foyers and similar areas, if requested, for example when donors/sellers are older. 

To request a pickup from FedEx for domestic shipping, the Accessioning Archivist will:

1. Call the FedEx customer service line at 1-800-463-3339.
2. Provide our account number located [here.](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/FedEx%20Account%20Information.docx?d=w1c94ec7fcaa04736ae2ecdf540770e5f&csf=1&web=1&e=tETqVb)
3. Request a remote pickup; FedEx Ground is standard.
4. Provide the same information that was provided for the shipping labels: pickup address, contact name and phone number, number of boxes, approximate total weight of entire shipment, as well as the requested day of pickup of the donor/seller.
5. Note the confirmation number and forward that information to the donor and curator. Indicate that this number is not a tracking number and may only be used by calling the 1-800 customer service number.

### 14.2.2.3 International shipping

The Library Mail Clerk cannot create international shipping labels. To create international shipping labels for FedEx, the Accessioning Archivist will:

1. Go to [fedex.com](www.fedex.com);
2. [Log into *My Profile*](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/FedEx%20Account%20Information.docx?d=w1c94ec7fcaa04736ae2ecdf540770e5f&csf=1&web=1&e=tETqVb);
3. Under Shipping, select “Create Shipment”;
4. Enter all of the pertinent information and click “Ship”;
5. A pdf of the labels will be created.

Once the labels are created, they may either be emailed as a .pdf to the donor/seller for printing or printed and mailed to the individual. This is a good opportunity to share with them our [packing instructions.](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/Packing%20instructions%20for%20donors%20shipping%20via%20FedEx.docx?d=w220c3220f3094b58938b27df8e17d4d1&csf=1&web=1&e=M3Iv30)

ULINE does not ship internationally. To provide the donor/seller with packing supplies, we either: 

* Advise the donor/seller of our standard box size and offer to reimburse them for the cost of shipping supplies (preferred).
* Order supplies from ULINE to the Rose Library and then ship them to the donor/seller internationally via FedEx with a completed Commercial Invoice for U.S. Customs. 

Sometimes, the Rose Library will contract out to a vendor to pack internationally, and that vendor will also need to be made aware of our packing requirements. They should include cost of shipping supplies when they provide an invoice for their services to the Operational Manager. Similarly, if staff is travelling to pack, staff can purchase supplies locally and charge to their corporate card, or on the Libraries’ FedEx account for purchases from FedEx.

Once the donor/seller is ready to ship, the Accessioning Archivist will request a pickup from FedEx for international shipping:

1.	Call the FedEx customer service line at 1-800-463-3339;
2.	Provide our [account number](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/FedEx%20Account%20Information.docx?d=w1c94ec7fcaa04736ae2ecdf540770e5f&csf=1&web=1&e=tETqVb);
3.	Request a “Remote Pickup” for international FedEx Express;
4.	Provide the same information that was provided for the shipping labels.

For international shipping, there is no guarantee that FedEx will accept our request for a pickup. Once we make the request, the donor/seller will receive a call from their local FedEx office to coordinate a pickup time directly. FedEx always advises that the request for pickup could be denied. It is important to communicate this risk to the donor since it is FedEx policy. Donors/sellers also have the option to drop off their packages at a FedEx location.

The Accessioning Archivist should be provided with tracking numbers in all cases.

## 14.3 FedEx guidelines

Emory University contracts with FedEx for shipping needs. Shipping is needed when either the donor or seller is shipping collection material to the Rose directly and/or a curator or other staff member is going to pack a collection that will then be shipped to the Rose. Please be aware that processes differ between domestic and international shipping methods.

### 14.3.1 FedEx Drop-Off
If a collection is approximately 20 boxes or less, there is a Rose Library staff member onsite, and the FedEx pickup location is a residence, the collection should be dropped off at a FedEx location by the Rose Library staff member. FedEx requires that someone 18+ years of age wait at the residence for a four hour window for a pickup, and how well the pickup goes is entirely dependent on the luck of the driver who is assigned the job. Dropping off small collections whenever possible is better for our donors. If the collection is too big or there are other factors preventing a drop-off, the Rose Library staff member should remain present for the FedEx pickup whenever possible. The Accessioning Archivist can potentially schedule pickups ahead of a packing trip with enough lead time and a relatively accurate estimate of number of boxes in order to make it possible for the staff member to plan to be present for the pickup.

Whenever possible, FedEx should not be used to move local collections. Collections in the Atlanta area may be transferred to the library by Rose Library staff or a local moving company. FedEx is only an option in exceptional circumstances.

### 14.3.2 FedEx Ground
#### DOMESTIC SHIPPING ONLY

* FedEx Ground cannot be used for international shipments;
* FedEx Ground pickups can be scheduled to occur for the next business day. It is prudent to give the Accessioning Archivist at least 48 hours' notice to schedule any FedEx pickup.
* FedEx picks up Ground shipments Monday-Friday. For businesses, they will come during business hours, 8:00am-6:00pm. For residences, they will come anytime between 8:00am and 8:00pm, and they will also pick up on Saturdays. For residences, a four hour timeframe can often be requested, depending on some additional contributing factors, such as amount of time between request date and pickup date.
* An adult over the age of 18 must be present for the FedEx pickup. FedEx may arrive any time during the designated window, including right before it closes.
* FedEx will not offer or guarantee a call prior to arrival, though one can be requested.
* FedEx policy is to not enter residences; they ask that boxes be left in an accessible area. However, they have been known to enter foyers and similar areas, if requested, when donors/sellers are older, for example. Again, this can be requested as part of the pickup but cannot be guaranteed.
* The Rose Library cannot guarantee a phone call or entrance to any dwelling by a FedEx driver.


### 14.3.3 FedEx Express (Express Saver)
#### DOMESTIC SHIPPING

FedEx offers several services under their "Express" umbrella, including Express Saver, 2Day, 2Day A.M., Standard Overnight, Priority Overnight, First Overnight, SameDay City, and SameDay. The differences between these services has nothing to do with the pickup procedures, just the delivery window. So, for our purposes, we will only use the most economical option, Express Saver, unless we are shipping from Alaska or Hawaii.

FedEx Express Saver is still significantly more expensive than FedEx Ground. For example, to send a 15lb package to Virginia costs $12.27 with FedEx Ground and $37.65 with FedEx Express Saver. For a 30lb package, the costs are $18.45 and $62.85, respectively. Cost goes up as distance (as relative to Atlanta) and weight increase.

It is recommended to only use FedEx Express Saver when all of the following criteria are met:

* 1. The pickup location is a residence.
* 2. There are more than 20 boxes;
* 3. A staff member is unable wait for the pickup;
* 4. Boxes could not be placed in an openly accessible area for the pickup and the donor will be unable to assist the driver with access to the boxes (such as lifting them over a threshold);
* 5. The donor/seller is unable or unwilling to wait for the pickup;
* 6. The pickup location is relatively close in proximity to Atlanta, Georgia (meaning in the Southeast). Please always offer FedEx Ground to the donor/seller first to gauge flexibility before offering FedEx Express Saver.
* FedEx Express pickups can be scheduled up until 7:15pm Monday-Friday for same day pickup (they will pick up within two hours after the request is made) and up until 1:00pm for Saturday for same day pickup. Saturday pickup is an additional charge. These cut off hours are based on picking up in Atlanta and may vary in other locations but will probably be similar in large cities like Atlanta. It is prudent to give the Accessioning Archivist at least 48 hours' notice to schedule any FedEx pickup.
* FedEx picks up Express shipments Monday-Friday with Saturday pickup available in many areas for an additional charge.
* A specific timeframe may be designated for a pickup (such as between 10:00am and 2:00pm); FedEx mainly wants to know how late they can pick up the shipment, as opposed to how early they can pick up the shipment.
* An adult over the age of 18 must be present for the FedEx pickup.
* FedEx will not offer or guarantee a call prior to arrival, though one can be requested.
* FedEx policy is to not enter residences; they ask that boxes be left in an accessible area. However, they have been known to enter foyers and similar areas, if requested, when donors/sellers are older, for example. Again, this can be requested as part of the pickup but cannot be guaranteed.
* The Rose Library cannot guarantee a phone call or entrance to any dwelling by a FedEx driver.

### 14.3.4 FedEx Express (International Economy)
#### INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING

* Once the Accessioning Archivist requests a FedEx pickup for International Economy and receives a confirmation number, the donor/seller will receive a call from their local FedEx office to coordinate a pickup time directly.
* International FedEx pickup requests are, indeed, requests-there is no guarantee that FedEx will accept our request for a pickup. FedEx always advises that the request for pickup could be denied. It is important to communicate this risk to the donor since it is FedEx policy. From February 2016 to present, none of our requests for pickup have been denied.
* Donors/sellers also have the option to drop off their packages at a FedEx location. This is especially encouraged in terms of international shipping, when possible, since the FedEx request is not guaranteed.
