## 14.1 Packing guidelines

Collection Services staff occasionally travel to a donor/seller (generally with the collecting curator) to assist in packing collections for transfer to the Rose. This will involve packing all desired material into standard sized boxes provided by the Rose and attaching shipping labels as appropriate. After the packing is complete, the Accessioning Archivist will arrange for the move of the material (generally via FedEx).  If there are any particularly fragile or valuable items, those should be hand-carried by the archivist rather than shipped.  If this situation should arise, consult with the Head of Collection Services to determine a plan of action.

When a curator requests packing assistance: 

* The curator will contact the Head of Collection Services with details of the trip, including the proposed dates and location. 
* The Head of Collection Services will communicate this information to the Collection Services team for volunteers to join the curator. 
* Traveling parties will coordinate together in terms of booking flights, hotels, etc. with the curator being the primary coordinator of the trip. 

Participating in packing gives Collection Services the opportunity to gather preliminary information about a collection, such as how material is arranged and used on-site.  Collection Services staff should take notes on the original order and use patterns, and photograph the space in which the records were used and kept whenever possible. Retain as many notes about collection material and decisions made on-site as possible while remaining efficient during the packing process. At this point, the packing team learns more information about the collection than anyone else and must be able to transfer the knowledge they gain on the trip to the accessioning team when they return to the library. 

Staff should follow [14.1 Packing Guidelines](#141-packing-guidelines) when packing a collection for transfer to the Rose.  

## 14.1 Packing Guidelines

### 14.1.1 Physical Handling

Make sure that all boxes used for transfer purposes are in good condition. The method of shipping and transfer may affect the kind of box used for packing. Local transfers may use bankers boxes with lids; however when shipping via FedEx or similar carrier, shipping boxes must be used. It is important that the boxes are within the following dimensions whenever possible so that we can shelve them while they await accessioning:

|        | Measurement            |
|--------|------------------------|
| Width  | 12 inches              |
| Length | 15 inches              |
| Height | 10.5 inches            |
| Weight | No more than 30 pounds |

Remove or mark out any old labels or markings. Ensure the boxes are stable and secure. This usually requires a double row of tape along the top and bottom seams and around the edges of the box.  Secure the center seams of bottom of each box with a double row of tape.  You do not need to tape down lids on banker's boxes being moved locally.

Files should be transferred to packing boxes in the order in which they have been stored (if there is one). Files should be packed so that they are standing upright in the boxes. To maintain original order and the context of creation and use, do not place any folders perpendicular to the main body of folders down the sides of the box or flat across the tops of the folders in the box.  It may not be clear to us later where those stray folders fit into the sequence of files.

If loose folder labels fall off during file transfer, make sure they are placed inside the folder they describe.

Boxes should be packed tightly enough that the files do not slump or shift, but should not be overstuffed. If the records do not fill the box, add crumpled paper, bubble wrap, or cardboard to keep the records upright and to prevent their contents from falling out and becoming mixed together during transit.  

If you finish packing a file drawer, category of record, or record location and there is still room in a box for more material, place a divider in the box to indicate the transition.

Place the preprinted label on the top side of each box. Each preprinted label comes in two parts: a top, thin part that has the tracking number for that label and then the actual label itself. Please retain the thin piece with the tracking number and provide those numbers to the Accessioning Archivist.

**Identification of records while packing:**

While packing, keep a running list of the general contents of each box and make sure to number the outside of the boxes with a marker on both the long and short end of the box (not the top of the box).

For example:

| Date: mm/dd/yyyy       |
|------------------------|
| List by: [name]        |
|                        |
| John Smith, Sr. papers |

| Box | Contents                             |
|-----|--------------------------------------|
| 1   | Business correspondence, 1950s-1960s |
| 2   | Business correspondence, 1950s-1960s |
| 3   | Business correspondence, 1950s-1960s |
| 4   | Scrapbooks, 1930s?                   |
| 5   | Awards received                      |
| 6   | Family photographs, 1940s?-1980s     |
| 7   | Family correspondence, 1940s?-1980s  |

If a collection includes born-digital files stored on the donor's current computer, the curator should notify the Head of Collection Services and the Digital Archivist at least two weeks in advance of any packing trip in order to allow time to plan and gather information and fill out the Born Digital Acquisitions [content](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/Born%20Digital%20Acquisitions%20Documents/Born-Digital_survey.docx?d=wcccb3b8e8603434b9f77f69aa3d405b9&csf=1&web=1&e=2I5cNF) and [technical](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Digital%20Collections/Forms,%20Surveys,%20and%20Handouts/BD_technicalSurvey.docx?d=w82829536ed7f4d64b460cad6dbd06bc0&csf=1&web=1&e=Oy0E7f) surveys.

Collection Services members should submit a report of all packing trips to the Head of Collection Services to be shared with the accessioning team. The report will include the container list made while on site, a general report of the physical space and how the records were created and used, and a high level collection analysis indicating potential series, along with any photographs they took of the collection before and during packing.  

### 14.1.2 Packing Supplies

The Accessioning Archivist will arrange to have shipping and other needed supplies sent to the packing location in advance of the packing trip (see [13.3 Shipping supplies](/13-SUPPLIES#133-shipping-supplies)), as well as request shipping labels for the travelers. 

Collection Services also maintains a packing supplies bag that should accompany staff on packing trips (nota bene: if flying, this bag must travel in checked luggage). This bag contains: 

* Box cutters and scissors;
* Screwdrivers, pliers, and wire cutters;
* Packing tape;
* Tape dispenser;
* Sharpies, pens, and pencils;
* Notebooks.

Review the contents of the bag two weeks prior to the trip, and identify items that need to be restocked. If you run out of supplies during the trip, purchase what you need on your corporate credit card (see [13.1 Office supplies](/13-SUPPLIES#131-office-supplies)).		

Supplies needed for the transfer of born-digital files from current computers may include:

* External hard drives and flash drives;
* Write blockers;
* Screwdrivers;
* The Digital Archives transfer laptop.

The Digital Archivist will be responsible for packing a bag with the necessary tools and equipment. This should be taken as a carry-on item due to fluctuating temperatures in the cargo hold and the potentially fragile nature of the devices. 

## 14.2 Moving and Shipping Collections

### 14.2.1 Local Collections

Collections in the Atlanta area are transferred to the library in one of two ways: 

* Emory staff move material ourselves;
* We hire a local moving company to move the collection to the Rose.

For either of these options the collection should be boxed in shelf-ready boxes and labeled. The Accessioning Archivist should be given as much notice as possible in order to arrange a supply order and stacks space for the material. 

**Emory staff moves materials:**

The most expeditious way to move small, local collections is often to have Rose staff transfer the material. Curators or Collection Services staff can: 

* Rent a car or van through Emory’s [local vehicle rental](https://www.finance.emory.edu/home/Procure%20and%20Pay/how_to_buy_in_the_marketplace/index_procure_pay_vehicle_limo_rental.html); 
* Use a personal vehicle to travel to pack the collection and submit for mileage reimbursement.

**Hiring local movers:**

The Rose Library currently contracts Flood Brothers movers to coordinate local moves. Both Flood Brothers and the Accessioning Archivist need at least two weeks’ notice to coordinate the move. Our contact at Flood Brothers is Barry Stewart ( ph.:404-799-3744 ext. 325; email: barry.stewart@floodbrothers.net).

To plan a local move the Accessioning Archivist needs to know: 

* Pick up address(es);
* Donor contact information;
* Number of boxes;
* Preferred date and time for the move;
* Any other information about the physical space (such as if the move will involve stairs, if there is parking at the pickup location, etc.). 

### 14.2.2 Shipping

Emory University contracts with FedEx when shipping collections. Processes differ between domestic and international shipping methods.

FedEx can pick up collections from donors' homes except in the following situations: 

* When material is too large for the standard boxes sent to the packing location. The packing team should take them to a FedEx location to be securely packed and shipped to the Rose Library using the FedEx account number. 
* When material is too fragile or when the only material gathered are born-digital files transferred to digital media, for example, a flash drive or external hard drive. In both instances, the packing team should plan to bring these materials back with them as carry-on items. 
* For international shipments, it is far preferable to drop packages off at a FedEx location, however, a FedEx pickup may still be arranged for international shipments if drop off is not an option.

### 14.2.2.1 Shipping supplies

The Rose recommends that collections are packed in boxes that we supply because we know that these boxes will fit on our shelves. Whether the donor/seller is packing the collection themselves or Rose Library staff is traveling to pack the collection, please send an appropriate amount of boxes and tape to the packing location. In the case of book collections, sometimes additional material may be needed, such as newsprint for cushion. Rose Library staff should refer to the packing instructions above. If donors/sellers are doing the packing, they should be provided with the [packing instructions for donors](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/Packing%20instructions%20for%20donors%20shipping%20via%20FedEx.docx?d=w220c3220f3094b58938b27df8e17d4d1&csf=1&web=1&e=M3Iv30), and curators should consult with them thoroughly about what material should be sent.

If shipping supplies are needed, please contact the Accessioning Archivist with:

* Number of boxes (sold in packs of 25);
* Amount of packing tape (sold in packs of 12 rolls);
* Any other supplies needed.

Typically, a good ratio is one pack of tape (12 rolls) per pack of boxes (25 boxes). Please also provide the shipping address and contact information for a recipient at the location, including name and phone number. Please allow 3 business days from point of order for supplies to arrive to the destination.

### 14.2.2.2 Domestic shipping 

Rose Library staff is responsible for procuring prepaid FedEx labels and providing them to the necessary parties. The Accessioning Archivist will email the Library Mail Clerk to request labels or the Facilities & Multimedia Assistant, if the Library Mail Clerk is out of the office. The email should include the return address (meaning the address where it is being picked up) with contact name and phone number and the approximate amount of boxes. All shipping labels should be addressed to the Accessioning Archivist. Labels may either be mailed to the donor/seller or carried by the Rose Library staff person traveling to pack a collection. The Library Mail Clerk will mail the labels, if needed.

Once a collection is packed, the boxes will either need to be taken to a FedEx location or the Accessioning Archivist will need to schedule a FedEx pickup. Some things to note:

* FedEx pickups require 48 hours’ notice from the first hour of the desired eight hour pickup window. 
* An adult over the age of 18 must be present in order for FedEx to pick up. 
* FedEx will not offer or guarantee a call prior to arrival. 
* FedEx policy is to not enter residences; they ask that boxes be left in an accessible area. However, they have been known to enter foyers and similar areas, if requested, for example when donors/sellers are older. 

To request a pickup from FedEx for domestic shipping, the Accessioning Archivist will:

1. Call the FedEx customer service line at 1-800-463-3339.
2. Provide our account number located [here.](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/FedEx%20Account%20Information.docx?d=w1c94ec7fcaa04736ae2ecdf540770e5f&csf=1&web=1&e=tETqVb)
3. Request a remote pickup; FedEx Ground is standard.
4. Provide the same information that was provided for the shipping labels: pickup address, contact name and phone number, number of boxes, approximate total weight of entire shipment, as well as the requested day of pickup of the donor/seller.
5. Note the confirmation number and forward that information to the donor and curator. Indicate that this number is not a tracking number and may only be used by calling the 1-800 customer service number.

### 14.2.2.3 International shipping

The Library Mail Clerk cannot create international shipping labels. To create international shipping labels for FedEx, the Accessioning Archivist will:

1. Go to [fedex.com](www.fedex.com);
2. [Log into *My Profile*](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/FedEx%20Account%20Information.docx?d=w1c94ec7fcaa04736ae2ecdf540770e5f&csf=1&web=1&e=tETqVb);
3. Under Shipping, select “Create Shipment”;
4. Enter all of the pertinent information and click “Ship”;
5. A pdf of the labels will be created.

Once the labels are created, they may either be emailed as a .pdf to the donor/seller for printing or printed and mailed to the individual. This is a good opportunity to share with them our [packing instructions.](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/Packing%20instructions%20for%20donors%20shipping%20via%20FedEx.docx?d=w220c3220f3094b58938b27df8e17d4d1&csf=1&web=1&e=M3Iv30)

ULINE does not ship internationally. To provide the donor/seller with packing supplies, we either: 

* Advise the donor/seller of our standard box size and offer to reimburse them for the cost of shipping supplies (preferred).
* Order supplies from ULINE to the Rose Library and then ship them to the donor/seller internationally via FedEx with a completed Commercial Invoice for U.S. Customs. 

Sometimes, the Rose Library will contract out to a vendor to pack internationally, and that vendor will also need to be made aware of our packing requirements. They should include cost of shipping supplies when they provide an invoice for their services to the Operational Manager. Similarly, if staff is travelling to pack, staff can purchase supplies locally and charge to their corporate card, or on the Libraries’ FedEx account for purchases from FedEx.

Once the donor/seller is ready to ship, the Accessioning Archivist will request a pickup from FedEx for international shipping:

1.	Call the FedEx customer service line at 1-800-463-3339;
2.	Provide our [account number](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/FedEx%20Account%20Information.docx?d=w1c94ec7fcaa04736ae2ecdf540770e5f&csf=1&web=1&e=tETqVb);
3.	Request a “Remote Pickup” for international FedEx Express;
4.	Provide the same information that was provided for the shipping labels.

For international shipping, there is no guarantee that FedEx will accept our request for a pickup. Once we make the request, the donor/seller will receive a call from their local FedEx office to coordinate a pickup time directly. FedEx always advises that the request for pickup could be denied. It is important to communicate this risk to the donor since it is FedEx policy. Donors/sellers also have the option to drop off their packages at a FedEx location.

The Accessioning Archivist should be provided with tracking numbers in all cases.

## 14.3 FedEx guidelines

Emory University contracts with FedEx for shipping needs. Shipping is needed when either the donor or seller is shipping collection material to the Rose directly and/or a curator or other staff member is going to pack a collection that will then be shipped to the Rose. Please be aware that processes differ between domestic and international shipping methods.

### 14.3.1 FedEx Drop-Off
If a collection is approximately 20 boxes or less, there is a Rose Library staff member onsite, and the FedEx pickup location is a residence, the collection should be dropped off at a FedEx location by the Rose Library staff member. FedEx requires that someone 18+ years of age wait at the residence for a four hour window for a pickup, and how well the pickup goes is entirely dependent on the luck of the driver who is assigned the job. Dropping off small collections whenever possible is better for our donors. If the collection is too big or there are other factors preventing a drop-off, the Rose Library staff member should remain present for the FedEx pickup whenever possible. The Accessioning Archivist can potentially schedule pickups ahead of a packing trip with enough lead time and a relatively accurate estimate of number of boxes in order to make it possible for the staff member to plan to be present for the pickup.

Whenever possible, FedEx should not be used to move local collections. Collections in the Atlanta area may be transferred to the library by Rose Library staff or a local moving company. FedEx is only an option in exceptional circumstances.

### 14.3.2 FedEx Ground
#### DOMESTIC SHIPPING ONLY

FedEx Ground cannot be used for international shipments;
FedEx Ground pickups can be scheduled to occur for the next business day. It is prudent to give the Accessioning Archivist at least 48 hours' notice to schedule any FedEx pickup.
FedEx picks up Ground shipments Monday-Friday. For businesses, they will come during business hours, 8:00am-6:00pm. For residences, they will come anytime between 8:00am and 8:00pm, and they will also pick up on Saturdays. For residences, a four hour timeframe can often be requested, depending on some additional contributing factors, such as amount of time between request date and pickup date.
An adult over the age of 18 must be present for the FedEx pickup. FedEx may arrive any time during the designated window, including right before it closes.
FedEx will not offer or guarantee a call prior to arrival, though one can be requested.
FedEx policy is to not enter residences; they ask that boxes be left in an accessible area. However, they have been known to enter foyers and similar areas, if requested, when donors/sellers are older, for example. Again, this can be requested as part of the pickup but cannot be guaranteed.
The Rose Library cannot guarantee a phone call or entrance to any dwelling by a FedEx driver.


### 14.3.3 FedEx Express (Express Saver)
#### DOMESTIC SHIPPING

FedEx offers several services under their "Express" umbrella, including Express Saver, 2Day, 2Day A.M., Standard Overnight, Priority Overnight, First Overnight, SameDay City, and SameDay. The differences between these services has nothing to do with the pickup procedures, just the delivery window. So, for our purposes, we will only use the most economical option, Express Saver, unless we are shipping from Alaska or Hawaii.

FedEx Express Saver is still significantly more expensive than FedEx Ground. For example, to send a 15lb package to Virginia costs $12.27 with FedEx Ground and $37.65 with FedEx Express Saver. For a 30lb package, the costs are $18.45 and $62.85, respectively. Cost goes up as distance (as relative to Atlanta) and weight increase.

It is recommended to only use FedEx Express Saver when all of the following criteria are met:

The pickup location is a residence;
There are more than 20 boxes;
A staff member is unable wait for the pickup;
Boxes could not be placed in an openly accessible area for the pickup and the donor will be unable to assist the driver with access to the boxes (such as lifting them over a threshold);
The donor/seller is unable or unwilling to wait for the pickup;
The pickup location is relatively close in proximity to Atlanta, Georgia (meaning in the Southeast). Please always offer FedEx Ground to the donor/seller first to gauge flexibility before offering FedEx Express Saver.
FedEx Express pickups can be scheduled up until 7:15pm Monday-Friday for same day pickup (they will pick up within two hours after the request is made) and up until 1:00pm for Saturday for same day pickup. Saturday pickup is an additional charge. These cut off hours are based on picking up in Atlanta and may vary in other locations but will probably be similar in large cities like Atlanta. It is prudent to give the Accessioning Archivist at least 48 hours' notice to schedule any FedEx pickup.
FedEx picks up Express shipments Monday-Friday with Saturday pickup available in many areas for an additional charge.
A specific timeframe may be designated for a pickup (such as between 10:00am and 2:00pm); FedEx mainly wants to know how late they can pick up the shipment, as opposed to how early they can pick up the shipment.
An adult over the age of 18 must be present for the FedEx pickup.
FedEx will not offer or guarantee a call prior to arrival, though one can be requested.
FedEx policy is to not enter residences; they ask that boxes be left in an accessible area. However, they have been known to enter foyers and similar areas, if requested, when donors/sellers are older, for example. Again, this can be requested as part of the pickup but cannot be guaranteed.
The Rose Library cannot guarantee a phone call or entrance to any dwelling by a FedEx driver.

### 14.3.4 FedEx Express (International Economy)
#### INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING

Once the Accessioning Archivist requests a FedEx pickup for International Economy and receives a confirmation number, the donor/seller will receive a call from their local FedEx office to coordinate a pickup time directly.
International FedEx pickup requests are, indeed, requests-there is no guarantee that FedEx will accept our request for a pickup. FedEx always advises that the request for pickup could be denied. It is important to communicate this risk to the donor since it is FedEx policy. From February 2016 to present, none of our requests for pickup have been denied.
Donors/sellers also have the option to drop off their packages at a FedEx location. This is especially encouraged in terms of international shipping, when possible, since the FedEx request is not guaranteed.
