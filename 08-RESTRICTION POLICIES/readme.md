## 8.1 Donor Imposed Restrictions

Donors may request that the Rose Library restrict portions of their collection.  The details of the restrictions should be worked out between the donor and curator during negotiations for the acquisition of the collection.  The restrictions should be described as explicitly as possible in the deed of gift or sale and should always include an expiration date.  Archival staff will have access to restricted material for the purposes of accessioning and processing but should keep information about the documents strictly confidential.  

The following is an example of a clear, detailed, and actionable set of donor restrictions:

*The following material will be restricted for a period of ten (10) years from the date of execution of this agreement:*

* *Correspondence: Young has provided a list of correspondents, mostly fellow writers, whose correspondence can be opened upon receipt by the Rose Library (see attached).  The remainder of the correspondence will remain closed for 10 years.*
* *Manuscript of Colson Whitehead’s first, unpublished, novel The Colossus of New York.*

*The following born digital material is permanently restricted if present on any of the transferred computers and should not be made available to researchers:*   

* *Email*
* *Digital photographs*

*The following material should be removed from the collection and returned to Young if identified by Rose Library staff:*

* *Financial records (records of a purely financial nature such as credit card statements or tax forms. Does not apply to other types of records such as contracts or permissions agreements where limited financial information may be present)* 
* *Medical records* 
* *Materials created by, or relating exclusively to, Young’s son, Mac*

*The Rose Library will consult with Young about any materials they find created by Young’s father, or collected or assembled by him in the course of his business as a physician, to determine whether to retain as part of the collection or return to Young.*

Restricted items can be described at the folder level in the finding aid unless the donor explicitly stated that description of the restricted materials should not be made public. In that case, restricted material can be described in broad terms at the box level, for example as "restricted correspondence." All restricted material should have AOs and container instances in ArchivesSpace.

## 8.2 Preservation restrictions

In some cases, original material may be too fragile for general access in the reading room and should be restricted.  
* For paper, photographs, and objects, consult with the Rose Library Preservation Liaison before making this decision.  If an items is deemed to be too fragile for use by researchers, Rose staff will make access copies of restricted documents when possible.  Items that are restricted due to fragility also receive higher priority in the conservation queue.
* Original sound and video/film recordings and born digital media are always restricted from use by patrons.  Patrons may examine the physical media, but may not access content via the original items.  Access copies of audiovisual and digital material will be made on demand or as part of normal processing workflows.

Additional guidance on preservation practices and workflows is available in [Section 11 Preservation](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/11-PRESERVATION).

## 8.3 Protection of Privacy in MSS and EUA collections

Collections contain the traces of an individual’s life, which can include documenting very public accomplishments, as well as very personal relationships and life events.  While restricted information or document types should be identified at the time of acquisition and outlined in the deed of gift or sale (or EUA transfer form), there are cases when Rose Library processing staff may identify confidential material in the course of working with a collection.  There are important legal and ethical distinctions between information that is considered confidential, and that which may be private or sensitive. 

| ﻿Confidential vs. Private |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Confidential records:    | Any records that must be restricted from public access for a period of time to ensure compliance with legal or statutory regulations.  Examples include third party student records (FERPA), personnel records, some medical records (HIPAA), social security numbers (restricted for 75 years), and privileged attorney-client or doctor-patient communications. |
| Private information:     | May include categories of information that a donor wishes to restrict for a period of time, such as correspondence with a particular individual, financial information, or records of or about a third party.                                                                                                                           |
 
To the best of our ability, and the extent that is reasonable based on the level of processing, Rose Library staff reviews collection material for records containing confidential information and redacts, removes, or otherwise restricts these documents.  In addition to confidential records, we also make every reasonable attempt to locate and redact or restrict any material stipulated in the donor agreement.  While the Rose staff makes every good faith effort to identify this information in the records, the nature of archival processing is to deal with records in the aggregate, and Rose staff are not in a position to examine or inspect every document.  Archivists are trained in document analysis and can generally identify series or portions of a collection that are the most likely to contain confidential information and will concentrate efforts on those groups.  
 
The legal right to privacy ends with an individual’s death.  Restrictions on social security numbers, grade sheets, or other potentially confidential records can be lifted at the end of a person’s life, and we will not redact this information about deceased individuals. 
 
Generally, staff does not evaluate collection contents for subjectively sensitive information.  Staff will not restrict material without a request from the donor or an affected third party, or outside of accordance with University policy or state and federal statute.  Collection Services will make this decision in consultation with the Head of Collection Services, the curator responsible for acquisition, the donor, and in accordance with professional ethical standards. 
  
 
## 8.4 Emory University Archives restrictions

The [Emory University Archives access policy](https://libraries.emory.edu/sites/default/files/2021-12/eua-access-policy.pdf) restricts access to certain categories of university records. The guidelines below provide guidance on implementing EUA restrictions during processing. These guidelines are a work-in-progress and will be updated as new scenarios arise during processing that require restriction and appraisal decisions to be made. 

For records created by Emory departments and offices, consult the [retention schedules](https://records.emory.edu/records-retention-schedules) for more information about the appraisal and disposition of specific records. 

For EUA collections of personal papers (i.e. faculty papers), consult [8.1 Donor Imposed Restrictions](#81-donor-imposed-restrictions) and [8.3 Protection of Privacy in MSS and EUA collections](#83-protection-of-privacy-in-MSS-and-EUA-collections).  

* A.	Unprocessed university collections are closed to research use.  Unprocessed university collections may be opened for research with permission and prior review by the University Archivist.  

* B.	Records of the Office of the President are closed to research use for 20 years beginning on the date on which the president leaves office.  The restriction applies to the entire body of records created during the president’s tenure.  

* C.	Records of the Board of Trustees and its committees are closed for 25 years from the date of creation.   
  * All Board of Trustees records are closed for 25 years except those records that were made publicly available (i.e. rosters of Board members).

* D.	Financial records and records relating to donors are closed for 75 years from the date of creation. 
  * All records of donors and donations made to the university are restricted for 75 years.
  * Departmental budget information does not need to be restricted, unless there are records of salaries or other financial compensation paid to individuals (see personnel records below).  
  * Financial information related to grants and awards, or donations for the specific purpose of funding grants, awards, etc., does not need to be restricted as this is public information (with the exception of salary info).
  * Expense reports and payment vouchers can be removed and discarded.

* E.	Student educational records such as credentials, grade sheets, correspondence, reports, notes, applications, and all other records pertaining to past and present students are governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and are restricted for 75 years from the date of creation.  
  * Generally student work should be removed and discarded.  
  * Student work intended for public display can be kept at the archivist’s discretion, if it has exceptional research value (for example, student projects on Emory history intended for public exhibit). 
  * Discard applications by students for programs, grants, etc.   
  * Letters of recommendation written by faculty on behalf of students do not need to be removed or restricted, since they are not part of the official university student record. 

* F.	Personnel related files of the University's faculty and staff, including search, review, promotion, reappointment, tenure, and disciplinary/grievance records, are restricted for 75 years from the date of creation. 
  * Records related to the salary of individuals and to financial compensation to individuals who were employed by the university, including contractors, should be restricted for 75 years. Departmental budgets and other aggregated information about salaries does not need to be restricted. If individual salary information is included in a departmental budget, that portion of the budget can be separated and restricted (if feasible).
  * Discard applications by faculty and staff for programs, grants, etc.; program and grant applications found in personal papers that belong to the creator of the collection may be retained at the archivist’s discretion.
  * All materials related to evaluation of faculty as part of the tenure process are restricted for 75 years.
  * Letters of recommendation for faculty written for the purpose of grants, etc. do not need to be restricted.

* G.	Medical records and patient/client files are restricted for 100 years from the date of creation.

## 8.5 Restricting and redacting materials during physical processing

See [10.6 Restricting and redacting materials](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#106-restricting-and-redacting-materials) for how to restrict materials during physical processing.
