* [4.1 Finding aids](#41-finding-aids)
	* [4.1.1 Main entry/creator](#411-main-entrycreator)

"Description is the creation of an accurate representation of…archival material by the process of capturing, collating, analyzing, and organizing 
information that serves to identify archival material and to explain the context and records systems that produced it, as well as the results of these 
processes."<a href="#anchor1"><sup>1</sup></a>  Description applies to both the archival material and the creators of archival material and reflects the relationships between the 
creator and the collection, materials within collections, and collections within repositories.  Description reflects both physical and intellectual 
arrangement but is not always an exact representation of that arrangement (for example, correspondence may be arranged at the item level but described at 
the folder level, or materials may be arranged at the box level and described at the item level).  Rose Library description follows guidelines established 
by Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS).

Finding aids are the most common form of description in the Rose Library, but description also refers to accession records, catalog records, and additional 
inventories/descriptions created by curators, dealers, donors, or appraisers during the acquisition process.  Description may be more or less detailed 
depending on the level of arrangement, the conditions under which a collection is being arranged, and the level of description that is sufficient to 
provide meaningful access to users.  For collections processed as part of accessioning work, description will likely be brief and general; the goal is to 
facilitate a basic level of access through minimal description.  For collections that are selected as annual processing priorities (or for small 
collections that can be fully processed during accessioning), description will be much more detailed and may include more complex structures, such as 
series and sub-series.

Collection level description is required for all collections, including a complete descriptive summary and complete administrative information, brief 
Biographical or Historical and Scope and Content Notes, and a box level inventory.  More detailed information can be provided for minimally processed 
collections at the archivist's discretion.  For collections processed at the series, folder/file, or item levels, longer Biographical/Historical Notes and 
Scope and Contents notes are necessary.  You may also include additional information in the Processing and Custodial History Notes, and create or refer to 
more detailed inventories.

Description can occur at multiple levels within collections and within series.  Certain materials, such as sound and video recordings, require item level 
description for access.  Other materials, such as newspaper clippings, do not require much description at all due to being commonly available outside an 
archive.  It may also be prudent to focus descriptive efforts on components of a collection that are reflective of the Rose Library's collecting policies, 
have high research value, are especially complex or idiosyncratic, or particularly illuminate something important about the creator.  Conversely, other 
components of the collection may receive less description.  This is at the archivist's discretion and should be explained in the processing note. 

## 4.1 Finding Aids

### 4.1.1 Main Entry/Creator

**DACS Chapter 2.6:**

Identifies the corporate bodies, persons, and families associated with the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials 
being described so that they might be appropriately documented and used to create access points by which users can search for and retrieve descriptive 
records.

**Required:** Required at the collection level.

The main entry heading is the main identity statement for the creator of the collection.  It is a primary access point for the collection.  There can be 
only one main entry heading.  Select as the creator the person, organization, agency, conference, or meeting that is primarily responsible for the creation 
of the material.  If multiple entities are equally responsible for creating the material, select the most recent creator, the creator who is most notable, 
or the creator who best represents Rose Library collecting areas (additional creators can be reflected in the title statement). 

Generally, the following types of collections will be entered under the heading for a person:

*	The personal papers of an individual, two or more individuals, or a family.
*	Artificial collections assembled by an individual (in which case the term "collector" is added to the heading).
*	An individual manuscript, letter, diary, etc.

Generally, the following types of collections will be entered under the heading for a corporation:

*	The corporate records of a single corporate body.
*	Individual official or government documents.

Generally, the following types of collections will be entered under the title statement (no main entry; this is the only exception to the requirement of 
this element) <a href="#anchor2"><sup>2</sup></a>

*	Artificial collections compiled by Rose Library.

When the Library of Congress has already established an authorized form of a creator's name, use that as the main entry exactly as established by LoC, even 
though it may be missing information.  If there is not a Library of Congress heading, follow the rules established by DACS and RDA to form the heading.  
Generally, the form of the name used should be the most common name by which a person or entity was known.  For individuals, this may be the name the 
person used to publish literary works.  For those who are not well known by a particular version of their name, use the fullest form of their name 
possible, including middle names or initials and birth or death dates when known. For companies or other organizations, the proper form of the name may be 
found on incorporation documents, financial records, letterhead, or other business records.  Corporate bodies can also include a geographic designation to 
distinguish them from other entities.

These guidelines are presented in their most basic form and there are always exceptions.  Consult with other archivists and/or the Rare Book Cataloger if 
necessary.  The Rare Book Cataloger can also establish headings through the Library of Congress when appropriate.

**Examples:**

| ﻿Individuals                                |                                         |

4.1.2 Title Statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The title statement records the title of the collection and the dates of coverage of the collection.

**************
4.1.2.1 Title
**************

**DACS Chapter 2.3:**

Provides a word or phrase by which the material being described is known or can be identified.

**Required:**  Required at all levels.  

The title best describes the contents of the collection, including the creator and a brief statement of the nature of the materials.  Always repeat the 
name of the creator as part of the collection title.  If a collection contains the administrative records of an organization or corporate body, use the 
term "records."  If a manuscript collection contains a variety of materials belonging to an individual or family, use the term "papers."  If the 
collection is artificially created by an individual or by the Rose Library, use the term "collection."  If the collection consists of a single record type 
or is overwhelmingly dominated by a single record type, use a term that describes the record type.  Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns in the 
title. 

**Examples:**

+--------------------------------------------------+
| **Collection level:**                            |
+==================================================+
| Rebecca Ranson papers                            |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Horace Mann and Julia W. Bond family papers      |
+--------------------------------------------------+

+--------------------------------------------------+
| James Burton diary                               |
+--------------------------------------------------+


At the series and subseries levels, the title statement must also include a description of the record types represented.  

**Examples:**

+--------------------------------------------------+
| **Series/sub-series level:**                     |
+==================================================+
| Office of the President records                  |

+--------------------------------------------------+
| Correspondence                                   |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Subject files                                    |
+--------------------------------------------------+

Folder titles may be formal or devised by the archivist. Formal titles are those transcribed from the original folder or directly from the material itself 
(e.g., the formal title of a published work). Devised titles are those created by the archivist to best describe the material within the folder. See also: 
Processing Note and Style Guide for additional guidance on folder titles.

4.1.2.2 Date
*************

**DACS Chapter 2.4:**

Identifies and records the date(s) that pertain to the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials being described.

**Required:** Required at all levels.

The date statement reflects the entire span of time during which a collection (or component of a collection) was created, accumulated, and maintained by 
the creator.  It should be repeated at every level of the finding aid.  Dates may be inclusive, approximate, predominant (bulk), or single.  

For inclusive dates, use the years only.  For single dates, use the year alone unless describing a single item, in which case use the year followed by the 
month and day.  If the exact date or dates are unknown, use approximate dates, indicated by "circa."  If the collection has large concentrations of 
material during a particular time period, use bulk dates in parentheses after the inclusive dates.  Bulk dates are useful when the span of a collection 
covers a broad range but the majority of the collection is concentrated within a smaller time period.  For example, when the earliest date is outside the 
life of the organization or when the volume of material within the bulk dates is considerably greater than the rest of the collection.

4.1.2.6 Restrictions on Access
*******************************

This field is a combination of two DACS elements: Conditions Governing Access and Physical Access.

**Conditions Governing Access**

**DACS Chapter 4.1:** 

Provides information about access restrictions due to the nature of the information in the materials being described, such as those imposed by the donor, 
by the repository, or by statutory/regulatory requirements.

**Required:** Required at the collection level.  Required at the series, sub-series, or file level when restrictions on those components are present.  

This field should note whether there are or are not any access related restrictions on the collection.  It must provide information about what is 
restricted, the date the restriction will expire, and the reason for the restriction (e.g., the restriction is legally mandated by FERPA, donor imposed, 
imposed by the archivist due to confidential third party information, etc.). This information could be provided in part by pointing to an access policy 
like the one used by University Archives (see below).  It should also record when a restriction has been lifted (including a date).

**Standard note** (all finding aids must include this note at the collection level when no restrictions are present): 

*	Unrestricted access

When describing restrictions, precede the first restriction note with "Special restrictions apply:."  Subsequent notes may follow without the prefix.

**Examples:**

*	[Description of item] is restricted until [date].
*	Series 1: Correspondence, financial records, and some family papers are closed to patrons until 2066.
*	Folders containing student materials are restricted in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) until [date].
*	At the donor's request, all financial records and journals are restricted until January 1, 2030.
*	Series 2: Financial records, contains a significant amount of confidential information about third parties. As a result, and in accordance to the Rose 
	Library's policy on confidential information, the series is closed to researchers until January 1, 2050.
*	Prior restrictions on Series 1: Correspondence expired on May 11, 2017.

The University Archives Access Policy provides further information about embargo periods for certain types of record (including financial, medical, student, and personnel records): http://rose.library.emory.edu/documents/university-archives/eua-access-policy.pdf.

When applicable, the following language is used for EUA use restriction notes:

*	Unprocessed collection. Collection is closed to research in accordance with Emory University Archives Access Policy for unprocessed materials.
*	Selected materials are closed to research in accordance with the Emory University Archives Access Policy for Board of Trustees records.
*	Selected materials are closed to research in accordance with the Emory University Archives Access Policy for Office of the President records.
*	Selected materials are closed to research in accordance with the Emory University Archives Access Policy for personnel records.
*	Selected materials are closed to research in accordance with the Emory University Archives Access Policy for student educational records.
*	Selected materials are closed to research in accordance with the Emory University Archives Access Policy for financial records.
*	Selected materials are closed to research in accordance with the Emory University Archives Access Policy for medical and patient/client records.

**Corresponding MARC field:** 506
**Corresponding EAD element(s):** ``<accessrestrict></accessrestrict>``

**Physical Access**

**DACS Chapter 4.2:**

Provides information about physical access restrictions due to physical characteristics or storage locations that limit, restrict, delay, or otherwise 
affect access to the materials being described.

**Required:** Required, when applicable, at the collection level.  Required at the series and sub-series levels when restrictions on those components are 
present.

This field identifies collections that are stored off-site, collections in which audiovisual materials are not yet digitized, and collections in which 
born-digital materials are not yet processed.  It also provides instructions for requesting access to such materials.  This field notes where researchers 
are asked to access surrogate copies of materials rather than the originals (e.g., photocopies, microfilm, digitized copies) and explains why.  It must 
also identify materials that require special handling that goes beyond standard reading room policies. 

**Examples of notes that must be used verbatim:**

*	Collection stored off-site. Researchers must contact the Rose Library in advance to access this collection.
*	Use copies have not been made for audiovisual material in this collection. Researchers must contact the Rose Library at least two weeks in advance for 
	access to these items. Collection restrictions, copyright limitations, or technical complications may hinder the Rose Library's ability to provide 
	access to audiovisual material.
*	Researchers must contact the Rose Library in advance for access to unprocessed born digital materials in this collection. Collection restrictions, 
	copyright limitations, or technical complications may hinder the Rose Library's ability to provide access to unprocessed born digital materials.
*	Use of the original digital media is restricted.
*	Access to born digital materials is only available in the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library.
*	Due to technical complications, the Rose Library is currently unable to provide access to remaining unprocessed born digital materials.

**Other examples:**

*	Due to the fragile nature of the material, some of the scrapbooks (OBV1-4) are closed to researchers.
*	For preservation reasons, researchers are encouraged to use the digital collection to access the majority of the photographs in Series 1 rather than 
	the original images.
*	Due to the fragile nature of some items in this collection, they may only be exposed to light for short amounts of time. Researchers will be asked to 
	limit the amount of time that they spend with such items.
