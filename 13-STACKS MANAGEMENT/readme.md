## 13.1 Onsite Stacks Management 

  

The Senior Collections Processing Archivist is responsible for maintaining the physical spaces where collection material is housed, primarily the stacks on levels 9 and 11. The Senior Collections Processing Archivist will periodically conduct inventories of these spaces and maintain shelf lists and other documentation related to collection storage space.  


### 13.1.1 Onsite Storage Locations 

* On Level 9:
	* Book Stacks 
	* Manuscript storage for unaccessioned manuscript collections (both MSS and EUA)
 	* Curatorial review shelves (09-32a) 
   
* On Level 11:
	* Main Stacks (the first room off of the elevator on Level 11) 
		* Manuscript collections (accessioned)
		* EUA Collections (both accessioned and unaccessioned)
		* Oversized bound volumes (OBVs) from MSS collections 
		* Bound volumes (BVs)from EUA collections
  		* Oversized papers (OPs) from EUA collections
    		* Storage closet contains some collection material  	 

	* The Nunnery 
		* Manuscript collections (both accessioned and unaccessioned) 
		* Vault 
		* Extra-oversized papers (XOP) shelving for MSS and EUA collections 
		* Oversized bound volumes (OBVs) from MSS collections 
		* LP boxes 

	* The Abbey
		* Oversized papers (OPs) from MSS collections 
		* Bound volumes (BVs) from MSS collections 
		* Hanging art storage 
		* Architectural drawings (rolled items)
		* Newspapers
    
  	* [Machine room--some EUA framed items are stored in the machine room on L11] 	

* Library Service Center 


We communicate stack locations by giving a range and bay for an item: 

* Ranges are one side of an aisle. These are numbered, and, in the books stacks, also given an A or B designation; 

* Bays are sections of shelving within the range. The bays receive alphabetical designations. When you are looking at a range the A bay will be on your left and proceed through the alphabet to your right. Always read bays left to right while facing them. 

* Shelves are the individual shelves within a bay. 

### 13.1.2 Box naming conventions based on shelving locations
Historically Rose Library has used several different nomenclature/box numbering conventions that are based on shelving locations. Some of these are still in use, while others should not typically be used for new collections:
* OP (oversized paper)--current usage is for folders larger than 20x24" but smaller than 38x34". These folders serve as top containers [container profile in ArchivesSpace= box folder (56x34 or less)]. Rolled items and scroll boxes that will fit on 38x34" shelves are also OPs.
* XOP (extra-oversized paper)--current usage is for folders that are too large to fit on the OP shelves, up to 56x34". 
* BV (bound volume)--generally not used for new collections
* OBV (oversized bound volume)--generally not used for new collections  
* FR (framed item)--primarily stored on art racks on 11-
* LP--phonograph record boxes that are stored on 11-
* CLP (combined LP)--phonograph record boxes that contain items from multiple collections and are stored on 11-
  

### 13.1.3 Systems of Record for Location Management

#### 13.1.3.1 Airtable (acquisitions and unaccessioned material)

The [Acquisitions and Accessioning base in Airtable](https://airtable.com/appxehhHnKmdPpzld/tblVOysdj8gmTooGt/viwM1W5reGNIwQRe3?blocks=hide) is the system of record for locations of unaccessioned manuscript and EUA material. Going forward, all new accessions should also have ArchivesSpace instances that include the location.

[Legacy note: The Pending Acquisitions tab of the [Master Shelf List](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/BoxDeletedUsers14/EeaPlvAEiXlDiYEIsCKKOmIBvtqxGMDbM50pZ5qmZaBWdg?e=QDYZBe) is no longer updated, but contains some legacy information about locations of unaccessioned materials in the backlog that may be useful.] 

#### 13.1.3.2 ArchivesSpace (accessioned MSS and EUA collections)

[ArchivesSpace](https://archives.libraries.emory.edu/staff/?login=true) is the system of record for locations of all accessioned MSS and EUA collections.

Going forward, all new accessions should also have ArchivesSpace instances that include the location.

#### 13.1.3.3 Master Shelf List (updated for accessioned MSS and EUA collections; born digital inventory)

Prior to 2023, Collections Services managed the location of all MSS and EUA collections in the [Master Shelf List](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/BoxDeletedUsers14/EeaPlvAEiXlDiYEIsCKKOmIBvtqxGMDbM50pZ5qmZaBWdg?e=cRPZYq) in SharePoint.

Although ArchivesSpace is now the system of record for locations for all accessioned MSS and EUA collections, we continue to update the Master Shelf List due to discrepancies and bad data in ArchivesSpace. Update the Master Shelf List:

* When a new collection is accessioned (physical or born digital) 

* When the extent of a collection changes  

* When a collection has physically moved from one location to another 

* When a collection is deaccessioned 

The Master Shelf List also has a tab for the born digital inventory
[Legacy note: The Pending Acquisitions tab of the Master Shelf List is no longer updated, but contains some legacy information about locations of unaccessioned materials in the backlog that may be useful.]

 

**Note:** In addition to the Rose stacks and the LSC, the Rose has material stored at CV Fine Art Storage and in dark storage at Access. The University Records Manager places all requests to retrieve material from Access. Our contacts to retrieve material at CV Fine Art are Mark Pennell at mpennell@classicdesignservices.com and Caroline Snowberger at caroline@classicdesignservices.com.  

  


  




The [Finding Aid](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Stacks%20Management/Shelf%20Lists/Book%20Finding%20Aid.xlsx?d=we8d5256705d646bcb01382b7add59f21&csf=1&web=1&e=pNBvCI> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Stacks%20Management/Shelf%20Lists/Book%20Finding%20Aid.xlsx?d=we8d5256705d646bcb01382b7add59f21&csf=1&web=1&e=pNBvCI") provides locations for book collections in the stacks on Level 9. 


### 13.1.3 Managing Locations in ArchivesSpace

  
### 13.1.4 Maintenance of movable shelving units

* Rose Library has unit... 
* We contract with Patterson Pope for maintenance of shelving in the stacks. If a compact shelving unit needs service, please notify the Senior Collections Processing Archivist who will contact facilities, who will contact Patterson Pope. During service calls, security will accompany service providers to the floor.   



## 13.2 LSC Ingest Policies and Procedures

## 13.2.1 Determining Eligibility for Transfer to LSC<a href="#anchor1"><sup>1</sup></a>

LSC is the preferred storage location for most types of collection materials and will be the default storage location for newly acquired manuscript and archival collections larger than 10 boxes, though smaller collections may also be selected for offsite storage.

No glass-based photographic material including glass-plate negatives, lantern slides, daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, and other cased images are eligible for transfer. 

No collection that has active mold may be transferred to the LSC; however, materials that were treated for mold may be transferred.

## 13.2.2 Physical Processing<a href="#anchor2"><sup>2</sup></a>
 
In order for material to be safely transferred to the LSC and easily identifiable once it is there all boxes must be clearly and accurately labeled and in containers that are both ingestible by the LSC and provide adequate support and protection for the material during transfer.   

## 13.2.3 Basic Minimum Housing Guidelines

* Boxes containing archival materials must have adequately fitting lids.  
* Flat boxes should have lids the cover the entire box; if these boxes have half-lids that do not cover the entire box, these lids must be tied-down.  
* Records center boxes must have intact handles.  
* To the extent possible, flat boxes should also be over 3 inches tall.
* Boxes must be under 40lbs in weight.
* Boxes with archival materials must be packed fully or with spacers or by other means to ensure materials are secure through transit.
* Phonograph boxes 13x13x6" may be sent to the LSC. (Phonograph boxes 17x17x6" cannot be sent to the LSC and must be stored onsite.) 

## 13.2.4 Basic Minimum Description Guidelines

**For archival materials:**

* Collection-level catalog (MARC) records that includes standard required notes fields (abstract, restrictions, language, summary, etc.) and has associated item records for each container being sent to the LSC is required.
* Collection-level finding aid with complete required notes fields per DACS.
* Box-level inventory that includes basic description of format and estimated date range is **required**. General content description at the box-level and a folder-list is **preferred**.   

## 13.2.5 Labels and Barcoding

All boxes must be labeled.  All labels need to include owning library, Collection Number, Title, and Box Number. 

All boxes going to the LSC must be barcoded, and the barcodes will need to be added to both Alma and the Finding aid. 

Barcodes should be placed above (preferred) or adjacent to the container label as follows:  

| Container             | Barcode location                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Record center cartons | On center above container label, below box lid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Document boxes        | On bottom center of attached box lid, above container label.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Flat/oversize boxes   | At a minimum, one label/barcode adjacent to box label on outward facing side of box; Preferably, two labels/barcodes adjacent to box labels on adjacent sides of box (one on a short side, the other on a long side).                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Oversize folders      | Adjacent to folder label (preferably located on open side of folder); For oversize folders (architectural drawings), I’d like to recommend we change the location of the barcodes as they will increase the height of the folders. I recommend we alternate to left, middle and then right. I think the label can remain constant. We typically put them on the right but can change. |
| Other                 | Above or adjacent to box label, below box lid if unattached.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

First, affix the barcode the box, placing it according to the physical handling recommendations listed above.  Always use a barcode protector strip to reinforce the barcode and prevent damage to the barcode.   

As you barcode, place one (or, in the case of flat boxes, 2) barcodes on the container and the duplicate copy of the barcode on the barcode sheet.  Once the barcode sheet(s) is completed it will be placed in a folder and filed.  

Add the barcodes to the Alma record. To do this, first create a holdings record for the collection.  The holdings record should have MARBL in subfield b of the 852 field and MSSTK in subfield c if the collection is remaining onsite, or LSC in subfield b and RSTORM in subfield c if the collection is going to the LSC.  If a collection is split between the locations you will need to make two holdings records, one for each holdings location.  The record will look like this:  

![Figure 1: Alma holdings record](/16-LSC%20TRANSFER%20POLICIES%20AND%20PROCEDURES/Images/Figure1.jpg "Alma holdings record")

Then add item records to that holdings record for each item in the collection.  Item records will need to include the barcode, a material type of Mixed Materials, an item policy of “Non-circ, reading RM Only” and the box number should be in the Description field.  The record will look like this: 

![Figure 2: Alma item record](/16-LSC%20TRANSFER%20POLICIES%20AND%20PROCEDURES/Images/Figure2.jpg "Alma item record")

Once all barcodes are entered into Alma you will need to wait overnight and then you can run the barcode script to insert the barcodes into the EAD finding aid for the collection.<a href="#anchor3"><sup>3</sup></a>

## 13.2.6 Sending Items to the LSC

Make sure the holdings record in Alma indicates the LSC as the holding library and the sublocation as RSTORM (Rose- Storage-Manuscripts).  The 852 field of your holdings record should look like this: 

![Figure 3: 852 field](/16-LSC%20TRANSFER%20POLICIES%20AND%20PROCEDURES/Images/Figure3.jpg "852 field")

Update the shelf list with the new LSC location.

If it is not a brand new acquisition (so a collection that has been on site and available to researchers for a while) then post a notice in the Collections channel on Slack to let people know that the collection is moving offsite.

Update finding aid to include the new location in the access restrictions note: 

``	
<accessrestrict encodinganalog="506">
		<head>Restrictions on Access</head>
		<p>Unrestricted access.</p>
		<p>Collection stored off-site. Researchers must contact the Rose Library in advance to access this collection.</p>
	</accessrestrict>
	``
	
You will need to wait 24 hours after changing the Alma holdings record to an LSC location before you can send the physical boxes offsite (this will ensure that the automated script that loads new barcodes into the LSC inventory control system has time to run and the new barcodes get into the system). 

**Put boxes on the designated shelving in the CTR.**

If you have oversized boxes that are 20x24 or larger, email Nathan to alert him that there are oversized boxes slated for pickup. 

## 13.2.7 Removing Boxes from the LSC

If a barcode needs to be removed from the LSC, email the LSC listserv with the barcode(s) that need to be removed.  

If the barcode needs to be removed from Alma right click on the "actions" button in the item list and select "withdraw" to remove the item record.

## 13.2.8 LSC Ingest Checklist

## 13.3 Documenting missing boxes and items

### 13.3.1 Documenting missing boxes

* If a MSS or EUA box is missing (and you can reasonably conclude that the container actually existed at one point):
  	* In In ASpace, change the current location for that container to “MISSING."
  	  	* Status = current
  	  	* Start date = add date when box was confirmed as missing
  	  	* Note = add note if there is additional relevant info to document, including the previous location where the box was supposed to be located.
  	  	* Location = Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library, Missing [MISSING, MSSTK]
  	* Figure 16: Example of location field for a missing container
  ![Figure 16: Missing box location field 1](/16-STACKS%20MANAGEMENT/Images/Figure16.jpg)
	* Figure 17: Another example of location field for a missing container
  ![Figure 17: Missing box location field 2](/16-STACKS%20MANAGEMENT/Images/Figure17.jpg)

	* For EACH of the archival objects linked to that container, add a Conditions Governing Access Note to restrict the item and make it not requestable.
		* Publish = true
    		* Restriction Begin = date item was confirmed missing
   		* Local Access Restriction Type = Select restricted
		* Content = Box is missing as of (date)

### 13.3.2 Documenting missing items and folders
* In ASpace, for the archival object that is missing, add after the title of the AO [MISSING]
* In ASpace, for the archival object that is missing, add a Conditions Governing Access Note:
  	* Publish = true
  	* Restriction Begin = Date item was identified as missing
	* Local Access Restriction Type = Blank [Do NOT select RESTRICTED as the local access restriction type. This will restrict the entire box and make the entire box unrequestable. There is no way to make a single folder within a box unrequestable, without making the entire box unrequestable.]
	* Content = Item/folder is missing as of (date) [You can also add any additional information that may be relevant]
* Add the missing item to the [Missing Manuscript Items spreadsheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/Ecxmy26MqsJMkF11zYyEG7wBB6TjioNCqMvxwRIzjhDg-g?e=DIInor), including relevant information about the search for the item.
* If an item is confirmed to be permanently missing and cannot be located anywhere:
  	* Add to the Missing Manuscript Items spreadsheet
	* Delete the Archival Object in ASpace
	* Add a memo to the CL-2 file documenting that the item was declared permanently missing and deleted from the finding aid.

### 13.3.3 Documenting missing items and folders without an identified container

* On rare occasions, a folder/item cannot be located due to containers being renumbered. For example, OPs in a collection were renumbered at some point and now an OP folder cannot be located.
* Check other logical containers (i.e. oversized folders and boxes) to try and locate the item. If the item cannot be located and you cannot identify the container that it should be in, document as follows.
* In ASpace, create a new top container. If there are multiple missing folders, merge all existing missing “containers” into that container.
	* Edit the container indicator to say “MISSING”
	* No container profile
	* No barcode
	* In ASpace, change the current location for that container to “Missing”.
		* Status = current
		* Start date = add date when box was confirmed as missing
		* Note = add note explaining the situation (see example below)
		* Location = Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library, Missing [MISSING, MSSTK]
    	* Figure 18: Example of an artificial container that is missing
       
![Figure 18: Artificial container that is missing](/16-STACKS%20MANAGEMENT/Images/Figure18.jpg)

* In ASpace, for the archival object that is missing, add a Conditions Governing Access Note to restrict the item and make it not requestable.
  	* Publish = true
  	* Restriction Begin = Date item was confirmed as missing
  	* Local Access Restriction Type = Select restricted [This will make the entire container unrequestable, but that is ok since it has been moved to a missing "container"]
  	* Content = Item/folder is missing as of (date)
* Add the missing item to the [Missing Manuscript Items spreadsheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/Ecxmy26MqsJMkF11zYyEG7wBB6TjioNCqMvxwRIzjhDg-g?e=DIInor)

### 13.3.4 Documenting missing books
  
* Missing books should be added to the [Missing books spreadsheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EfTaM8c26vROpWCkE5obViABudgB1RfE2MynHNIGMTyyrQ?e=1qSuPa). 
* The Rare Book Librarian will mark the item as missing in Alma [LINK TO CATALOGING MANUAL]
