## 13.1 Systems of Record for Location Management

#### 13.1.1 Airtable (acquisitions and unaccessioned material)

The [Acquisitions and Accessioning base in Airtable](https://airtable.com/appxehhHnKmdPpzld/tblVOysdj8gmTooGt/viwM1W5reGNIwQRe3?blocks=hide) is the system of record for locations of unaccessioned manuscript and EUA material. Going forward, all new accessions should also have ArchivesSpace instances that include the location.

[Legacy note: The Pending Acquisitions tab of the [Master Shelf List](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/BoxDeletedUsers14/EeaPlvAEiXlDiYEIsCKKOmIBvtqxGMDbM50pZ5qmZaBWdg?e=QDYZBe) is no longer updated, but contains some legacy information about locations of unaccessioned materials in the backlog that may be useful.] 

#### 13.1.2 ArchivesSpace (accessioned MSS and EUA collections)

[ArchivesSpace](https://archives.libraries.emory.edu/staff/?login=true) is the system of record for locations of all accessioned MSS and EUA collections.

Going forward, all new accessions should also have ArchivesSpace instances that include the location.

#### 13.1.3 Master Shelf List (updated for accessioned MSS and EUA collections; born digital inventory)

Prior to 2023, Collections Services managed the location of all MSS and EUA collections in the [Master Shelf List](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/BoxDeletedUsers14/EeaPlvAEiXlDiYEIsCKKOmIBvtqxGMDbM50pZ5qmZaBWdg?e=cRPZYq) in SharePoint.

Although ArchivesSpace is now the system of record for locations for all accessioned MSS and EUA collections, we continue to update the Master Shelf List due to discrepancies and bad data in ArchivesSpace. Update the Master Shelf List:

* When a new collection is accessioned (physical or born digital) 

* When the extent of a collection changes  

* When a collection has physically moved from one location to another 

* When a collection is deaccessioned 

The Master Shelf List also has a tab for the born digital inventory
[Legacy note: The Pending Acquisitions tab of the Master Shelf List is no longer updated, but contains some legacy information about locations of unaccessioned materials in the backlog that may be useful.]


#### 13.1.4 Alma holdings location


#### 13.1.5 Book Finding Aid

The [Book Finding Aid](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EWcl1ejWBbxGsBOCt63VnyEBaZUth59gnSMWr7h2w6rymw?e=6RrgQf)  provides locations for books collections in the Level 9 stacks.


## 13.2 Onsite Stacks Management 

  

The Senior Collections Processing Archivist is responsible for maintaining the physical spaces where collection material is housed, primarily the stacks on levels 9 and 11. The Senior Collections Processing Archivist will maintain documentation related to locations and collection storage space.  


### 13.2.1 Onsite Storage Locations 

* On Level 9:
	* Book Stacks 
	* Manuscript storage for unaccessioned manuscript collections (both MSS and EUA)
 	* Curatorial review shelves (09-32a) 
   
* On Level 11:
	* Main Stacks (the first room off of the elevator on Level 11) 
		* Manuscript collections (accessioned)
		* EUA Collections (both accessioned and unaccessioned)
		* Oversized bound volumes (OBVs) from MSS collections 
		* Bound volumes (BVs)from EUA collections
  		* Oversized papers (OPs) from EUA collections
        * Storage closet contains some collection material  	 

	* The Nunnery 
		* Manuscript collections (both accessioned and unaccessioned) 
		* Vault 
		* Extra-oversized papers (XOP) shelving for MSS and EUA collections 
		* Oversized bound volumes (OBVs) from MSS collections 
		* LP boxes 

	* The Abbey
		* Oversized papers (OPs) from MSS collections 
		* Bound volumes (BVs) from MSS collections 
		* Hanging art storage 
		* Architectural drawings (rolled items)
		* Newspapers
    
  	* Machine room
  		* EUA framed items 	


We communicate stack locations by giving a range and bay for an item: 

* Ranges are one side of an aisle. These are numbered, and, in the books stacks, also given an A or B designation; 

* Bays are sections of shelving within the range. The bays receive alphabetical designations. When you are looking at a range the A bay will be on your left and proceed through the alphabet to your right. Always read bays left to right while facing them. 

* Shelves are the individual shelves within a bay. 

### 13.2.2 Box naming conventions based on shelving locations
Historically Rose Library has used several different nomenclature/box numbering conventions that are based on shelving locations. Some of these are still in use, while others should not typically be used for new collections:
* OP (oversized paper)--current usage is for folders larger than 20x24" but smaller than 38x34". These folders serve as top containers [container profile in ArchivesSpace= box folder (56x34 or less)]. Rolled items and scroll boxes that will fit on 38x34" shelves are also OPs.
* XOP (extra-oversized paper)--current usage is for folders that are too large to fit on the OP shelves, up to 56x34". XOPs may be stored onsite or at the LSC.
* BV (bound volume)--generally not used for new collections
* OBV (oversized bound volume)--generally not used for new collections  
* FR (framed item)--primarily stored on art racks on 11-
* LP--phonograph record boxes that are stored on 11-
* CLP (combined LP)--phonograph record boxes that contain items from multiple collections and are stored on 11-
  
### 13.2.3 Maintenance of movable shelving units

* We contract with Patterson Pope for maintenance of shelving in the stacks. If a compact shelving unit needs service, please notify the Senior Collections Processing Archivist who will contact facilities, who will contact Patterson Pope.  


## 13.3 Offsite Storage: Access Storage

Rose Library has material stored at Access Storage. The Records Manager has access to the database of records stored at Access and places all requests to retrieve material from Access. 


## 13.4 Offsite Storage: Library Service Center - DRAFT

### 13.4.1 LSC Ingest Policy on Preservation Specifications (2014)

See the [policy document in SharePoint.](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/IQBgwxmZw7ZCTZZe_EbcKcKnAdmPb9vcGWpMMyXvaqvbjmk?e=wu2Spc)

### 13.4.2 Determining Eligibility for Transfer to LSC

LSC is the preferred storage location for most types of collection materials and will be the default storage location for newly acquired manuscript and archival collections.

The following types of materials cannot be sent to the LSC:
* Fragile materials
* Glass-based photographic material including glass-plate negatives, lantern slides, daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, and other cased images
* Materials with active mold (materials that have been treated for mold may be transferred)
* Oil paintings

### 13.4.3 Basic Minimum Housing Guidelines
Materials sent to the LSC must be the basic minimum housing guidelines below.

**For archival materials:**
* All materials should be housed in an appropriate top container, either a box or a flat folder. Unboxed objects cannot be sent to the LSC.
* Boxes must have adequately fitting lids.  
* Flat boxes should have lids the cover the entire box; if a flat box has a half-lid that does not cover the entire box and is likely to come off in transit, the lid should be tied down.  
* Records center boxes must have intact handles.  
* Boxes must be under 40lbs in weight.
* Boxes must be packed fully or with spacers or by other means to ensure materials are secure through transit.
* Boxes must have a label and a barcode, affixed according to the instructions in [10.9 Labeling boxes](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#109-labeling-boxes) and [10.10 Barcoding boxes](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#109-labeling-boxes).

**For print materials:**
* 


### 13.4.4 Guidelines on Size of Materials and Containers
Materials sent to the LSC must be appropriately sized for storage there; LSC shelving is 36" x 53.25".

* All standard sized containers that meet the minimum housing guidelines can be sent to the LSC.
* For 16x20" and 20x24" boxes, it is preferred to use 3" high boxes for materials that will be sent to the LSC.
* Scroll boxes up to 4x4x48" can be sent to the LSC. [See 10.8.4.7 for more information on scroll boxes.](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#10847-scroll-boxes)
* Phonograph boxes 13x13x6" may be sent to the LSC. (Phonograph boxes 17x17x6" cannot be sent to the LSC and must be stored onsite.)
* Oversized flat boxes up to 28x22x3" can be sent.
* For oversized flat boxes larger than 28x22x3", you must receive permission  

## 13.2.4 Basic Minimum Description Guidelines

**For archival materials:**

* Collection-level catalog (MARC) records that include standard required notes fields (abstract, restrictions, language, summary, etc.) and has associated item records for each container being sent to the LSC is required.
* Collection-level finding aid with complete required notes fields per DACS.
* Box-level inventory that includes basic description of format and estimated date range is **required**. General content description at the box-level and a folder-list is **preferred**.
* Alma  




## 13.2.6 Sending Items to the LSC

Make sure the holdings record in Alma indicates the LSC as the holding library and the sublocation as RSTORM (Rose- Storage-Manuscripts).  The 852 field of your holdings record should look like this: 

![Figure 3: 852 field](/16-LSC%20TRANSFER%20POLICIES%20AND%20PROCEDURES/Images/Figure3.jpg "852 field")

Update the shelf list with the new LSC location.

If it is not a brand new acquisition (so a collection that has been on site and available to researchers for a while) then post a notice in the Collections channel on Slack to let people know that the collection is moving offsite.

Update finding aid to include the new location in the access restrictions note: 

``	
<accessrestrict encodinganalog="506">
		<head>Restrictions on Access</head>
		<p>Unrestricted access.</p>
		<p>Collection stored off-site. Researchers must contact the Rose Library in advance to access this collection.</p>
	</accessrestrict>
	``
	
You will need to wait 24 hours after changing the Alma holdings record to an LSC location before you can send the physical boxes offsite (this will ensure that the automated script that loads new barcodes into the LSC inventory control system has time to run and the new barcodes get into the system). 

**Put boxes on the designated shelving in the CTR.**

If you have oversized boxes that are 20x24 or larger, email Nathan to alert him that there are oversized boxes slated for pickup. 

## 13.2.7 Removing Boxes from the LSC

If a barcode needs to be removed from the LSC, email the LSC listserv with the barcode(s) that need to be removed.  

If the barcode needs to be removed from Alma right click on the "actions" button in the item list and select "withdraw" to remove the item record.

## 13.3 Documenting missing boxes and items

### 13.3.1 Documenting missing boxes

* If a MSS or EUA box is missing (and you can reasonably conclude that the container actually existed at one point):
  	* In In ASpace, change the current location for that container to “MISSING."
  	  	* Status = current
  	  	* Start date = add date when box was confirmed as missing
  	  	* Note = add note if there is additional relevant info to document, including the previous location where the box was supposed to be located.
  	  	* Location = Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library, Missing [MISSING, MSSTK]
  	* Figure 16: Example of location field for a missing container
  ![Figure 16: Missing box location field 1](/16-STACKS%20MANAGEMENT/Images/Figure16.jpg)
	* Figure 17: Another example of location field for a missing container
  ![Figure 17: Missing box location field 2](/16-STACKS%20MANAGEMENT/Images/Figure17.jpg)

	* For EACH of the archival objects linked to that container, add a Conditions Governing Access Note to restrict the item and make it not requestable.
		* Publish = true
    		* Restriction Begin = date item was confirmed missing
   		* Local Access Restriction Type = Select restricted
		* Content = Box is missing as of (date)

### 13.3.2 Documenting missing items and folders
* In ASpace, for the archival object that is missing, add after the title of the AO [MISSING]
* In ASpace, for the archival object that is missing, add a Conditions Governing Access Note:
  	* Publish = true
  	* Restriction Begin = Date item was identified as missing
	* Local Access Restriction Type = Blank [Do NOT select RESTRICTED as the local access restriction type. This will restrict the entire box and make the entire box unrequestable. There is no way to make a single folder within a box unrequestable, without making the entire box unrequestable.]
	* Content = Item/folder is missing as of (date) [You can also add any additional information that may be relevant]
* Add the missing item to the [Missing Manuscript Items spreadsheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/Ecxmy26MqsJMkF11zYyEG7wBB6TjioNCqMvxwRIzjhDg-g?e=DIInor), including relevant information about the search for the item.
* If an item is confirmed to be permanently missing and cannot be located anywhere:
  	* Add to the Missing Manuscript Items spreadsheet
	* Delete the Archival Object in ASpace
	* Add a memo to the CL-2 file documenting that the item was declared permanently missing and deleted from the finding aid.

### 13.3.3 Documenting missing items and folders without an identified container

* On rare occasions, a folder/item cannot be located due to containers being renumbered. For example, OPs in a collection were renumbered at some point and now an OP folder cannot be located.
* Check other logical containers (i.e. oversized folders and boxes) to try and locate the item. If the item cannot be located and you cannot identify the container that it should be in, document as follows.
* In ASpace, create a new top container. If there are multiple missing folders, merge all existing missing “containers” into that container.
	* Edit the container indicator to say “MISSING”
	* No container profile
	* No barcode
	* In ASpace, change the current location for that container to “Missing”.
		* Status = current
		* Start date = add date when box was confirmed as missing
		* Note = add note explaining the situation (see example below)
		* Location = Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library, Missing [MISSING, MSSTK]
    	* Figure 18: Example of an artificial container that is missing
       
![Figure 18: Artificial container that is missing](/16-STACKS%20MANAGEMENT/Images/Figure18.jpg)

* In ASpace, for the archival object that is missing, add a Conditions Governing Access Note to restrict the item and make it not requestable.
  	* Publish = true
  	* Restriction Begin = Date item was confirmed as missing
  	* Local Access Restriction Type = Select restricted [This will make the entire container unrequestable, but that is ok since it has been moved to a missing "container"]
  	* Content = Item/folder is missing as of (date)
* Add the missing item to the [Missing Manuscript Items spreadsheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/Ecxmy26MqsJMkF11zYyEG7wBB6TjioNCqMvxwRIzjhDg-g?e=DIInor)

### 13.3.4 Documenting missing books
  
* Missing books should be added to the [Missing books spreadsheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EfTaM8c26vROpWCkE5obViABudgB1RfE2MynHNIGMTyyrQ?e=1qSuPa). 
* The Rare Book Librarian will mark the item as missing in Alma [LINK TO CATALOGING MANUAL]
