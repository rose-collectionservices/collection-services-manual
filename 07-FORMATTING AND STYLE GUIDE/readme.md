*Purpose and Limitations of this Style Guide*

This style guide was written to offer guidance on local usage and particulars that are regular questions for Rose Library archivists.  

This style guide aligns with Emory Communications’ style guide and uses Chicago Style as a default. For style questions not addressed by this manual, please consult the most recent version of the Chicago Manual of Style. 

DACS, RDA, and name authority rules trump this style guide.
