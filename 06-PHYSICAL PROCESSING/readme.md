This document provides guidance on specific arrangement and description tasks, according to local policy and practice at the Rose Library. 

When writing descriptive records for the Rose Library you should conform first and foremost to the conventions of the descriptive or bibliographic standard (DACS, MARC) that you are using.  The Emory University Communications and Public Affairs Office provides additional [style guidance](http://communications.emory.edu/resources/identity/guidelines/style-guide-editorial/index.html) for Emory publications related content and Collection Services maintains a [unit-specific style guide](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Manuals/CS%20Formatting%20and%20Style%20Guide.docx?d=w2df9086f1e054dae8759c45d7167703c&csf=1&web=1&e=jZhKev) for issues that commonly arise during description, including grammatical and spelling preferences and guidance on formulating folder titles. 

## 6.1 Foldering Materials

### 6.1.1 Use of original folders

If the original folders are in good shape, they may be retained as primary housing for the materials. Always retain original containers and folders if they contain important or substantive writing, or if they bear a unique relationship to their contents.  Otherwise, folder titles and other basic information may be transcribed and the original container discarded.  If a folder or envelope is too large or bulky to fit in a standard size box, the relevant information can be photocopied and the original item can be discarded. 

### 6.1.2 Creasing and stuffing folders

* Use legal-size folders as the default.
* When foldering, ensure that the folder is creased to the appropriate width for the materials inside. The folder should fit the contents snugly like the cover of a book. Leaving too much space or overstuffing the folder can cause damage such as slumping and tearing. This includes using a bone folder as needed to create a new crease that is not at the precreased lines.

### 6.1.3 Folder titles

* Folder titles may be formal or devised by the archivist. Formal titles are those transcribed from the original folder or directly from the material itself (e.g., the formal title of a published work). Devised titles are those created by the archivist to best describe the material within the folder.
* See also [17.5 Folder titles](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/17-FORMATTING%20AND%20STYLE%20GUIDE#175-folder-titles) for additional guidance on formatting and style of folder titles.

### 6.1.4 Labeling folders

Folders should be labeled with the following information: 

* Abbreviated form of the collection title (usually the creator's last name or an abbreviation of the organization's name);
* Collection number;
* Series/subseries title, if applicable;
* Bolded header, if applicable;
* Box number;
* Folder number;
* When adding folders to artificial (miscellaneous) collections or when interfiling a small number of folders in existing collections (additions), also add the accession number to the left corner of the front flap.

Separate the collection title and manuscript number, series and subseries titles, and box and folder numbers with a slash.  The box number always precedes the folder number.  When using bolded headers, they should be followed by a colon before writing the folder title.  Separate segments of the folder title with commas. 

![Figure 1: Folder labeling](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure1.jpg "Folder labeling")

### 6.2 Routine preservation during processing

Preservation treatment in a collection corresponds to the level of arrangement and description for the collection. During high level/minimal processing, archivists look mostly for large-scale problems that affect the entire collection (or large parts of it) such as mold and water damage; large segments of fragile documents that need to be stabilized or restricted from use; poor packing; lack of folders; and items that need special housing such as oversized or bound material.

During detailed processing, archivists may do more granular preservation work like removing rusty fasteners and sleeving torn documents. Preservation activities at this level should focus on mitigating further damage to the collection and enhancing access for patrons while maintaining efficient use of staff time. For example, staff should always make preservation photocopies of thermal fax paper because there is no other way to prevent loss of information. However, staff should not make preservation photocopies of newspaper clippings as a matter of course because of the common availability of that information.

Conduct the following minor preservation work during granular processing:

* Properly folder and box materials (see 6.1.2 Proper foldering technique and 6.x.x. Boxing collections)
* Remove letters from envelopes. This ensures that continued refolding over time in the reading room will not weaken paper fibers and lead to tears.
* Unfold/flatten all documents, including bent corners. As above, this reduces repeated folding and unfolding that weakens the paper and causes tears. Smoothing bent corners prevents papers from catching on each other and causing more damage. Use discretion when unfolding oversized material; if the item does not warrant oversized storage, unfold it as much as possible and leave it in a standard legal folder.
* Remove rusting hardware and fasteners that are causing damage to material. This includes staples and paper clips that are causing physical damage such as tearing and rusty fasteners that have eaten through paper or left stains. This does not include slightly rusted or corroded staples and paper clips that have not caused damage to this point. Stable environmental controls will prevent damage from developing.
* Photocopy all thermal fax paper (glossy paper similar to receipt paper). The nature of fax paper causes information printed on it to fade over time. Photocopying is the only way to preserve that information. When photocopying, if all of the content of a document transfers legibly to the photocopy, discard the original fax. If severely faded areas of the original fax do not copy and show as blank spots on the photocopy, keep both the original and the new copy.
* Disbind material in three-ring binders or spiral bound booklets that are causing damage or are difficult to folder. Pages that have been stored in three ring binders often stick together over time. Very carefully separate these pages. If they will not easily separate, consult the Rose Library Preservation Liaison.
* Sleeve torn documents in mylar.
* Flag significantly damaged documents for further conservation treatment. A significantly damaged document is torn in half or still at risk even after it has been sleeved.
* Sleeve old or torn photographs in polyester photograph sleeves. Do not sleeve all photographs as a matter of course.
* Do not attempt to mend documents with pressure sensitive tape, even tape marketed as "archival."
* If you encounter moldy materials, see [9.2 Moldy materials](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/09-PRESERVATION#92-moldy-materials)

For questions about possible preservation needs in a collection, consult the Rose Library Preservation Liaison. When processing is complete, be sure to bring to the attention of the Preservation Liaison all preservation issues that may need to be sent to Preservation for further treatment.

## 6.3 Appraisal and weeding during processing

See [8.2 Appraisal during arrangement](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/08-APPRAISAL#82-during-arrangement)

## 6.4 Restricting and redacting materials

### 6.4.1 Restricting materials
For restriction policies, see [Section 7 Restriction policies](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/07-RESTRICTION%20POLICIES).

* Items that are restricted should be foldered separately:
	* If the entire folder is restricted, title it as you normally would. Then at the end of the title write [Restricted until YEAR] if the restriction end date is known. Otherwise simply write [RESTRICTED].
 	* If only individual items are restricted, separate those items from the rest of the contents of the folder and folder them separately. Handle the original unrestricted folder and the new restricted folder as a series of folders by giving both folders identical titles then adding [1 of 2] and [2 of 2] at the end of the title. If necessary you can use a [MSS separation sheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EStul3EWAvVLqf7lTER_dfwBhGOl41Y5ZoEes6wzQYkZJQ?e=I8Ddew) or [an EUA separation sheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/ER0YmElt_wVApRIfeUUaq9cB1uAjrYWzz7TYQgMD5YlfKw?e=AcC5UV) to document the separation of the restricted items; however, typically this is not necessary because giving the folders the same title is sufficient, as it indicates that the contents were originally part of a single folder. At the end of the restricted title write [Restricted until YEAR] if the restriction end date is known. Otherwise simply write [RESTRICTED].
* For items restricted for preservation reasons, create access copies and surrogates for fragile material when possible.
* Items that are restricted should be boxed separately. See XXX for boxing restricted items.

For restriction notes, see 5.16.1 Restrictions Governing Access.](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/05-DESCRIPTION#5161-conditions-governing-access)



### 6.4.2 Redacting materials

Often, rather than restricting an entire document, you can simply redact the information in question and provide access to the altered copy in place of the original.   

To redact information, either:

* Place an opaque bit of paper over the information to be redacted and make a photocopy (do not adhere the paper to the original document);
* Include the following text on the photocopy:  "This is a redacted copy of the original document, with [redacted information, i.e. Social Security Numbers] obscured to protect the privacy/security of the individuals mentioned." 

Or:

* Make a photocopy of the original document;
* Using a black Sharpie marker, block out the information to be redacted on the photocopy;
* Make a second photocopy and dispose of the first copy in the confidential shredding bin;
* Repeat if sensitive information is still visible on the second copy;
* Include the following text on the photocopy:  "This is a redacted copy of the original document, with [redacted information, i.e. Social Security Numbers] obscured to protect the privacy/security of the individuals mentioned." 

NEVER redact the original document itself.  If the original document has intrinsic value (original correspondence, etc.), restrict the document as normal and retain in the collection.  If the original document is not unique (forms, title pages without annotations, etc.), the original can be discarded in the confidential shredding bin. 

## 6.5 Separating Materials 
[moved from Section 7 Restrictions--needs additional editing]

For access and preservation considerations, some materials may be physically removed from their original location. Materials can be moved either to different locations within a collection or be removed from the collection and managed separately.

### 6.5.1 Attachments
Items that are attached to each other should only be separated under limited circumstances. Always remove sound or video/film recordings, books, and other bulky items that affect storage when they are attached to letters or other documents. If a photograph or other printed item is attached to a document, there is no need to separate the items unless there is something extraordinarily compelling about the attachment and separate description is required.

If an item is intricately related to another item in a series, the archivist should create a [separation sheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EStul3EWAvVLqf7lTER_dfwBhGOl41Y5ZoEes6wzQYkZJQ?e=I8Ddew) to document the relationship between the two items. Complete the form, attaching one copy to the original item and a second copy to the item being removed. Separation should be done judiciously and only in cases where access to the item is significantly improved by separation.

In the case of an audio or video recording accompanying a letter or other document, fill out the separation form and file it with the original document. Create a cross reference to the document in an item level scope and content note in the container list for the audio or video recording. For example [Originally filed in Series 1: Correspondence, Letter from April Chung to May Riley, January 24, 1999]

### 6.5.2 Publications
Published monographs, broadsides, and periodicals that are rare or are closely connected to our broader collecting areas are removed and cataloged. 

* For publications that do not contain any annotations, signatures, or other unique features, the processing archivist should check the catalog to see if the Rose Library already holds a copy. If so, the item can likely be deaccessioned. Confer with the curator responsible for acquisition of the collection to determine if there's a compelling reason to keep the copy in question with the collection.
* If the item is being removed from the collection to be cataloged separately, complete a ["Removed from MSS Collection (to be cataloged)" flag](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EWRcr9mWsX5Cocagr52UkrgBBmgc-G_MTueHiRd_GBArWg?e=SW7XAL), insert it into the publication, and shelve the item on the designated range. When dealing with large quantities, it is more efficient to complete the form electronically and print out the appropriate number of flags. Do not leave books in records center cartons or other boxes on the rare book shelves. When publications are attached to documents and that provenance must be preserved, complete the [Separation Form (Books)](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EQ7V6fQc9g1Bl8hqPq1NSTwBNcXKH5h0gIqhxVGAvnrwqw?e=dxjkzg) and follow the procedures as normal.
* If the publication is being deaccessioned, either return to the donor or to Better World Books as appropriate.

## 6.2 Empty Envelopes

Retain empty postal envelopes that include return addresses.  These can be arranged at the end of a group of correspondence as "Envelopes, empty." 

## 6.3 Photographs [so you found some photographs...]

Generally speaking, in collections where photographs are only one part, the photographic value of the material is usually incidental. In these cases, item level arrangement and description is almost never warranted. Photographs can be arranged and described at the file level and will mostly not be sleeved. Photographs that are attached to paper documents or part of subject files should be left in their original locations (see Restriction and Separation for additional guidance on when and how to separate photos). If photos are put at increased risk of degradation because of their proximity to newsprint or other formats in a subject file, use folder inserts to segregate the photographs. Early or rare photographic formats may require additional considerations, even in a mixed format collection. Fragile photographs should always be sleeved and stored with care.

For additional guidelines and detailed information about processing photographs, see below.

## 6.4 Newspaper Clippings

Newspaper clippings should be appraised for their relevancy to a collection and only those that are about the creator or their work should be kept.  Clippings are commonly available outside the archives and should never be arranged or described in detail.  They can be described as "Clippings, [date range]" and be boxed or foldered without sorting.  Preservation photocopies should not be made, nor should clippings be unfolded to create oversized papers (OP).  Weed duplicates if they're obvious, but do not waste time trying to identify duplicates. 

#### 6.5 Framed items
When possible, **framed items** such as photographs, certificates, or artwork, should be unframed and stored according to the size of the item. If it is not possible to remove the frame, the item can be secured with pH buffered paper or bubble wrap and housed in an oversized box. In this case, it should be described in the finding aid according to the instructions above regarding oversized materials. Do not send framed items with glass to the LSC. Framed items that cannot be boxed should be labeled and hung on the 11th floor art racks. Describe these items in the finding aid as framed items (FR). Do not affix labels to the frames themselves. Print a small (4" x 2") label, affix the label to a strip of acid free card stock, punch a hole in the top, and tie the label to the hanger on the frame. If the frame does not have hanging hardware on the back, consult with the preservation liaison. Do not add any framed items to the art racks without first identifying and labeling them appropriately. 


## 6.5 Audiovisual Materials [so you found some cassette tapes...]

[This section needs a thorough update.]

Audiovisual materials can be described separately by format or intellectually with other records by function.  Physically, sound and video recordings should be housed in audiovisual (AV) masters boxes.  For preservation purposes, sound and video recordings should be housed separately when possible.  When working with a small amount of recordings, everything can be housed together in one box. 

In order to keep the Rose Library in line with current best practices and standards, the arrangement and description of audiovisual materials in our holdings was changed based on the documentation of the Archives of American Art grant project (CLIR, "Hidden Collections," 2012-2015).  More information about that project is available on AAA’s website (http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/projects/clir).

Since The Rose Library is conducting more thorough processing at the point of accession, much of the arranging and describing of audiovisual materials will be done at this point, focusing mainly on the physical storage and identification of the materials rather than on the intellectual arrangement of the materials in a finding aid.

For more information on the Audiovisual Liaison workflow for digitization of materials, please use this [document ](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EUqt0cH4y2tPuj6W1wXNdDgB3kq8wxMglsmifxg-Yt6RAw?e=T7c85r> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EUqt0cH4y2tPuj6W1wXNdDgB3kq8wxMglsmifxg-Yt6RAw?e=T7c85r").

## 6.5.1 Accessioning/Minimal Level Processing

Audiovisual materials will be rehoused upon accessioning into boxes labeled "AV."  If more than one box is used, it is preferable to keep audio and visual boxes (e.g. keep all audio together in one box and remove video to another as this will aid in digitization procedures).  Individual items can be rehoused as well at this point (audiocassettes should be in some kind of case) to ensure that damage does not occur.  

### 6.5.1.1 Rehousing upon accessioning

Upon accessioning, materials should be rehoused into AV Masters boxes.  Some individual materials may require rehousing (i.e. the individual cases or boxes for tapes), but archivists should use their judgment as to whether this is necessary.  It is preferable to do if the housing or item is broken, deteriorating, or unsupportive.  Original housing that is not broken and does not have acid stains or discoloration is adequate and can generally be left alone.  Materials that come in without sufficient housing or cases should be placed in one. should be housed.

When replacing housing, unless the original housing is completely blank, photocopy old housing and folder the copy of the original container in its entirety with the media object (to later be cross referenced). If you are removing the housing, be sure to photocopy printed information on the original media housing that relates to the media such as brand, footage length, tape thickness, etc. 

In cases, where there are only a few phonographs, we utilize the CLPs, or combined LP boxes which house items from collections that would not fill an entire LP box.  Since many phonographs require boxes that are taller than ordinary Hollinger boxes, they require special shelving, so we house materials from multiple collections within one box to save space, hence the title "combined LP." The phonographs should be labeled with a divider that identifies the collection with the MSS number and collection name. The label on the box should reflect the collections held within the box.  While preferable to keep materials from collections together, it is not necessary. This can be done at the point of accessioning to ensure the preservation of materials that may not be fully processed quickly.

Since The Rose Library is conducting more thorough processing at the point of accession, there are two levels that will be used to arrange and describe the materials at this point: enhanced and minimal. 

* Enhanced arrangement and description:
	* If there are few items, the items should be listed out at the title level if the item is labeled. Include notable access points for researchers (e.g. names of important figures, exhibition titles or locations, or titles of media artworks).
	* If the materials are part of an obvious series (i.e. "part 1, part 2…") the items can be listed at a single level with a note about the number of items and date range.
	* If any detailed documentation of materials' content exists in the collection (e.g. transcripts, shot lists, or logs describing content), cross reference the documentation rather than describing any detailed content of the media itself in the finding aid.
	
**NOTE:** At the point of accessioning, unidentified audiovisual items can listed as an unidentified series/subseries/bolded header.

* Minimal arrangement and description:
	* Items should be removed to an AV Masters box.
	* Brief content description taken from labels on media or accompanying documentation. Just listing that the box contains audiovisual materials is not enough, and care should be taken to provide content description. 
	* Grouping related to media is sufficient if unable to verify specific content or sequence of media items.
	* Number of materials and formats should be noted.
	* Duplicate and originals will be filed together if possible.
	
* In both cases: 
	* If physical media is labeled with a lot of detail, it is not necessary to include all detail in the finding aid, containers with content written on them should be photocopied and cross referenced with the item.
	* At the point of accessioning, there is no requirement to play media to identify content. Audiovisual material with no documentation should be labeled "unidentified," and further described by physical format (e.g. "unidentified, undated [original: audio cassette]").
	* If unlabeled media is found with paper records but the relationship is unclear, it is better to leave it with those records to preserve a possible relationship; the presence of AV can be noted in a scope note for the paper component. 
	 
	 If materials are commercial recordings and will not be digitized or made available to researchers, the physical items can be removed from the collection.  However, if this is done, and the archivist should note the identity of each title with the following language: 
	
	"Researcher access is restricted due to copyright; there is no access copy. Original recording was removed from holdings"
	
	The following language should be included at the series and/or subseries level regarding the accessibility: 
	
	"Commercial recordings are not digitized and content is not available due to a risk assessment of copyright restrictions.  A list of titles are included in the inventory for researchers to identify the holdings of the creator.  These materials are available commercially and can be accessed via other sources."
	
At this time, the accessioned materials should be listed in the [Additions to the Audiovisual Inventory form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=nPsE4KSwT0K80DImBtXfOB8h8E_9r5RCthRr1wsf1axUNjFITEY4U1JVUzZDRTlCV1RGOEZBMFNCQS4u) for future digitization.  These materials will be considered backlog for digitization and the location will be noted in the [Master Shelf List](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/BoxDeletedUsers14/EZiyR14OgtROk_YUuYsg6MEBiy1izTutJ3BUfHmJM7wAxg?e=gCYaC3).

## 6.5.2 Processing

Audiovisual materials should be fully processed in conjunction with the paper materials of the collection, and minimal level processing should have been done at accessioning, so materials should be identified at least at that level.  It is likely that as of 2016, most collections will have not gone through the accession procedure listed above, so extra attention should be paid to those materials that have not been identified.  Regardless of the accessioning procedure followed, the following will need to be done for identification:

* If not accessioned to the standards expressed in this document (i.e. if no processing at the point of accessioning has been done), item-level (or at least subject-level) description should be completed.  
* If there is no identification or the labels are ambiguous, the Audiovisual Conservator should be contacted to schedule a time to play the items.  In many cases, the Audiovisual Conservator or staff will review the content as digitization is happening, and they will notify the archivist of non-archival materials for further review. 
* Sound recordings should be grouped physically with other sound recordings while video recordings should be grouped with other video.  If the total amount of audiovisual materials is less than a half linear foot, all audiovisual material should be placed in the same box.
* If a recording has extensive, detailed labeling that adds to the description, photocopy the item and cross reference it in the finding aid.  This can be done by creating folder titles or bolded headers.

To keep the Rose Library in line with current processing standards, audiovisual materials will be arranged intellectually with materials of the same subject.  For example, if there are recordings of poetry readings by the creator, those items should be listed in the series that contains other writings.  In some cases, these materials will not fall under another series value and will require their own series, for example “Interviews and Lectures.”  Series can also be expanded, so “Writings” may become “Writings and Creative Works” or “Printed material” may be expanded to “Printed and Presented works."

While it is recommended to physically keep audio and visual materials separate, they should be combined within the finding aid by intellectual content.  

Also, recordings of meetings can be arranged within an administrative record series.
If there is content of multiple subjects on a single tape (i.e. multiple presentations on a VHS tape or two distinct meetings on either side of an audiocassette), describe each intellectual item in a separate component in the finding aid and note where the item is found on the tape if known.

While we can refer to the individual cassette, film, or tape as an item, it is important to remember that, like folders, the audiovisual item holds more than just "an item." When processing, you should consider them as containers.  While a paper manuscript may be one thing, it is made up of multiple sheets and is arranged and described at the file-level, and identifying audiovisual items this way keeps us in-line with best practices. 

To identify the material within the finding aid, folder titles that include audiovisual items should end with [original: format type].  For example:

![Figure 14: Representing AV in the container list](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure14.jpg "Representing AV in the container list")

Note: Image includes a date format that is no longer used.  The approved format is Year Month Day.

There is no need for a folder number within the AV box.  In some cases, as in off-site digitization projects involving a large number of items, these item-numbers will be generated for the purpose of tracking the materials.  In this case, we will keep the numbers.  Instances where item-numbers (usually transferred to a folder number in the finding aid) should not be compiled just to have a folder number (i.e. if the number isn't needed for an external cause, we do not create this numbering system for processing). If this information is available, it can be used, but collections with small amounts of audiovisual materials, this is unnecessary.

Duplicates should be kept until material is digitized whereupon they can be considered for weeding.

Phonographs, because of their size, often do not fit on regular sized shelves and are housed on the LP shelves in the Nunnery. In the case that there are not enough LPs from one collection to fill a phonograph box, they may be housed in one of the combined LP (CLP) boxes. For CLPs: The container list will include the actual CLP number in the box column with a dash in the place of the folder number.  For example:

![Figure 15: Representing CLPs in the container list](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure15.jpg "Representing CLPs in the container list")

Note: Image includes a date format that is no longer used.  The approved format is Year Month Day.

Unless otherwise identified, “phonograph” is a catch-all for the various forms of recorded disks.  Care should be made to identify the type, but this will allow for enough definition until digitization. Processing staff should use the [Media Guide](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Audiovisual%20Materials/Audiovisual%20documentation_administrative/Media%20Guide.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=vawA0O) to identify formats.

## 6.5.3 Notes on Access
If materials are commercial recordings and will not be digitized or made available to researchers, the physical items can be removed from the collection. However, if this is done, and the archivist should note the identity of each title with the following language:

"Researcher access is restricted due to copyright; there is no access copy. Original recording was removed from holdings"

The following language should be included at the series and/or subseries level regarding the accessibility:

"Commercial recordings are not digitized and content is not available due to a risk assessment of copyright restrictions. A list of titles are included in the inventory for researchers to identify the holdings of the creator. These materials are available commercially and can be accessed via other sources."

## 6.6 Boxing Collections and Numbering Boxes

### 6.6.1 General guidelines
Processed collections should be placed into acid-neutral, archival containers.  In the Rose, we primarily house collections in Hollinger document cases or Paige Miracle boxes.  These boxes are expensive and should not be used for temporary storage projects in cases where the boxes will be broken back down at the end of a project.

Folders should be placed within the box with enough room that the archivist's fingers just reach the bottom. The box should be full enough that folders do not slouch, but not so full that folders cannot be removed easily. If a box is properly packed, a single folder can be partially lifted from the box and not fall back down.  Partially filled or overstuffed boxes cause damage such as slumping and tearing. Spacers should be used when there are not enough folders to fill a box properly (usually necessary in the last box of paper materials in a collection). If materials have been removed for preservation or exhibition, space should be held for those materials.

Boxes in a collection should get numbered in a single sequence, with the exception of boxes with other naming conventions (see below). Labels should say "Box 1," "Box 2," etc.

### 6.6.2 Box naming conventions by shelving location

See [Section 16.2 Box naming conventions by shelving location](


### 6.6.3 Materials that should be boxed separately

**Restricted material** must be housed separately from the rest of the collection [(see 6.6.5)](#665-boxing-and-labeling-restricted-material).

**Audiovisual materials** in granularly processed collections should be housed separately and placed in boxes labeled "AV." 

**Born digital materials** in granularly processed collections should be housed separately and placed in boxes labeled "BV."

**Material that has been treated for mold** must be housed separately from the rest of the collection [(see 6.6.4)](#664-labels-for-materials-treated-for-mold).   



### 6.6.4 Oversized materials

* Material that fits into a box should be boxed. It is greatly preferred to have a box as the top container. 
* #### Oversized boxes that will be stored at the LSC (typically up to 20x24"; it is strongly preferred for all new collections to be sent to the LSC)
	* Any oversized material that fits into a box and will be stored at the LSC should be given **regular box and folder numbers** in sequence with material stored in other box types. OP numbers should **not** be used for boxes being sent to the LSC, since the OP indicates a shelving location
* #### Oversized boxes that will be stored onsite (typically up to 20x24") (OPs)
	* When a collection is being stored onsite, the oversized boxes will remain onsite as well and will be handled as OPs (oversized papers)
 	* Any box designated as an OP must be stored onsite on the OP shelves on Level 11 in the Abbey
    	* OP boxes should be given OP numbers to indicate that it is being onsite on the OP shelves. In a collection OPs should be a separate sequence of numbers from the general box number sequence (i.e. OP1, OP2, etc.). When making the label, there is no space between OP and the number (i.e. OP1).
     	* Folders within an OP box are also numbered sequentially in the same fashion as regular size folders, for example OP1/1, OP1/2, etc.		
* #### Oversized material larger than 20x24" but smaller than 38x34" (OPs)
	* Oversized material larger than 20x24" will not fit in a standard oversized box, as the largest standard sized box that we typically order is 20x24", but larger or custom boxes can be ordered in some instances.
 	* If the oversized material will not fit in a box, it should be placed in an oversized folder as the top container.
  	* Oversized folders of these dimensions (i.e. will fit on the OP shelves) should be handled as an OP.	
  	* Rolled items and scroll boxes that will fit on 38x34" shelves should also be handled as OPs
  	* OP folders or OP rolled items serve as top containers in ArchivesSpace
  		* OP folder container profile in ArchivesSpace = box folder (56x34 or less)
  	 	* Rolled item container profile = rolled item
  	  	* Scroll box container profile = scroll box [choose best size]
  	  		  	
  	  	 




* XOP (extra-oversized paper)--current usage is for folders that are too large to fit on the OP shelves, up to 56x34". 
* BV (bound volume) and OBV (oversized bound volume)--while we currently have materials identified by "BV" and "OBV," we have moved away from that nomenclature and should keep these materials in appropriately sized boxes with the regular box numbers. Bound volumes (BV) and oversized bound volumes (OBV) are usually ledgers, scrapbooks, photograph albums, or other bound items.  


#### 6.6.3 Oversized materials

**Preferred: for collections that are or will be primarily stored at the LSC:** Any material that fits into a box (instead of a folder) . Folders up to 24" x 36" should be given an OP (oversized papers) number to indicate that it is being stored onsite on Level 11 in the Abbey. Materials larger than that will be given an XOP (extra-oversized papers) number to indicate that it is being stored onsite on Level 11 in the Nunnery. The LSC will accept boxes up to 20" x 24," and boxes sent to the LSC should be given regular box numbers rather than OP numbers since OP references a shelving location. Due to space constraints in oversized material shelving in the Abbey and the Nunnery, newly accessioned or processed oversized material should be sent to the LSC when possible.

**For collections that are or will be primarily stored onsite:** Documents and photographs larger stored in folders larger than 20" x 24" should be given **oversized papers (OP)** numbers to indicate that they are being shelved onsite on Level 11 in the Abbey.  Materials larger than 24" x 36" should be given **extra-oversized papers (XOP)** numbers and are shelved in folders in the Nunnery.

Legacy content: WBound items that will fit in Hollinger document case should be placed in folders and stored as normal. Bound items that will fit in boxes up to 20" x 24" and are part of collections that are or will be stored primarily at the LSC should be stored as normal and the boxes given regular box numbers. Bound items that are part of collections that are or will be stored onsite and are too large to reside with the rest of collection should be boxed separately and identified in the finding aid as BVs or OBVs. When boxing multiple items together, insert a strip of acid-free card stock into each item identifying it. Bound items that are part of collections that are or will be stored at the LSC and are too large for a 20 x 24" box should be identified with a strip of acid-free card stock, identified as an OBV in the finding aid, and placed on appropriate shelving onsite.

**OP, XOP, BV, and OBV numbering** is similar to numbering regular size boxes and folders. Boxes for bound and oversized material **staying onsite** are numbered sequentially with OP, BV, or OBV preceding the numeral. For example, OP1, OP2, BV1, OBV1, etc. Folders or bound items within the boxes are also numbered sequentially in the same fashion as regular size folders. For example, OP1/1, OP1/2, BV1/1, etc. External housing should be labeled with a printed label (see below). Within boxes, folders and items may be labeled by hand. Folders going directly on shelves (e.g., 24" x 36" OP folders or 36" x 48" XOP folders) should have a printed label placed in the bottom lefthand corner of the folder opening. *Note: Oversized and bound material going to the LSC should receive regular box and folder numbers.*







### 6.6.3 General labels

**Box labels** should include the following information (see figure 2 for an example): 

* Emory University;
* Rose Library;
* Manuscript or EUA number;
* Main entry (dates do not have to be included and should not be included if they're subject to change, i.e. if the person is still living); 
* Collection title (do not include the date range in the title statement since it will change in the event of accruals);
* Box number.

![Figure 2: Box labeling](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure2.jpg "Box labeling")

*Figure 2*


There are three sizes for labels. The most commonly used is the [4" x 3 1/3" labels](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Manuscript%20Box%20Labels/MSSlabels%20101-200.doc?d=w22bbbb9e7367446a8b9f668b968c1827&csf=1&web=1&e=zxIl64). These are used for record center boxes and Hollinger boxes.  Smaller labels measuring [4" x 2"](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Manuscript%20Box%20Labels/MSSlabels%20[small]%201-100.doc?d=w33190c2d0c574d44a4ce8d245a1ebf84&csf=1&web=1&e=NYu0hh) are used for the half Hollinger boxes as well as the OP boxes.  There is an [additional template for the 4" x 2" labels](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Manuscript%20Box%20Labels/MSSlabels%20[1.5%20depth%20boxes].doc?d=w894f959bdda44618866d3fb30162f097&csf=1&web=1&e=7SKAx4), specifically formatted for OP boxes measuring 1.5" in depth. 

**Examples:**

*Hollinger box (.5 linear feet):* Label should be placed in the middle, under the flap. The barcode should be placed on the middle of the bottom of the flap.

![Figure 3: Regular Hollinger box](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure3.jpg "Regular Hollinger box")

*Half Hollinger box (.25 linear feet):* Label should be placed in the middle, under the flap. The barcode should be placed on the middle of the bottom of the flap.

![Figure 4: Half Hollinger box](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure4.jpg "Half Hollinger box")

*Record center box (1 linear foot):* Label should be placed in the middle, under the handle with enough room to place the barcode between the handle and the label. 

![Figure 5: Record center box](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure5.jpg "Record center box")

*Oversized papers box (also applies to bound and oversized bound volume boxes):* Label should be placed on the left side of the front of the box. The barcode should be placed to the right of the label. 

![Figure 6: Oversized papers box](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure6.jpg "Oversized papers box")

### 6.6.4 Labels for materials treated for mold

Boxes that have been treated for mold must be housed separately from the rest of the collection and should be labeled with a mold notice label, which should be printed on white paper. (Previous versions of mold labels were printed on bright colored paper; we have moved away from this so the labels are less alarming to researchers.) The label should be affixed to the end of the box. Oversized boxes may not always have enough space on the front for the label. In this case, put the label in a logical place on the front and/or top of the box so they are visible to staff and patrons. You can use scotch tape to affix the label to the box but make sure the labels are taped on all sides. See figures 7-9 for examples.

### 6.6.5 Boxing and Labeling Restricted Material

Materials deemed restricted must be boxed separately and should be boxed in a way that facilitates providing access to the material once the restrictions have expired.  For example, if there are multiple levels of restriction in a collection, box materials subject to the same restrictions together; for example, box all materials that can be opened to researchers in 2030 together.  When the restrictions expire, the box can simply be relabled and folders within redescribed as accessible in the finding aid. The box should be clearly stamped with the red RESTRICTED stamp to avoid any unauthorized access (see figure 10). 

[For more information about restriction policies, see Section 7: Restriction and Separation Policies and Procedures.](07-RESTRICTION)

![Figure 10: Restricted material](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure10.jpg "Restricted material")

*Figure 10*

There may additionally be restrictions on how patrons may use material, such as **prohibitions on photography** or **reproduction restrictions** that are also indicated by a stamp on the label. See figures 11-13 for examples.

![Figure 11: No personal photography](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure11.jpg "No personal photography")

*Figure 13: When the restriction only applies to one or a few folders in the box, also stamp the folders with the "no camera" stamp as a visual cue for patrons and staff.*


## 6.7 Deep dives by format
### 6.7.1 Photographs

Archivists will use the following guidelines and their professional discretion to determine appropriate levels of arrangement and description for photographs in Rose Library collections. These guidelines are meant to offer general guidance for archivists working with photographs, though there are a few prescriptive rules.

There are many factors to consider when deciding on a processing level for photographs: context of acquisition; context of creation; fragility and conservation needs; relationship to other material in the collection; informational, evidential, and artifactual value; and presence of identifying information. Photographs are a growing collecting priority for the Rose Library and the rationale for selecting a collection is an important factor in determining processing level for photographs. At the Rose Library, we acquire photographs in three broad contexts: 1) as one part of a larger collection documenting an individual or organization; 2) collections of fine art photography by a single photographer; or 3) as part of a collection of photographs documenting a single subject and collected specifically because they are photographs. 

In collections where photographs are only one part, the photographic value of the material is usually incidental. In these cases, item level arrangement and description is almost never warranted. Photographs can be arranged and described at the file level and will mostly not be sleeved. Photographs that are attached to paper documents or part of subject files should be left in their original locations (see Restriction and Separation for additional guidance on when and how to separate photos). If photos are put at increased risk of degradation because of their proximity to newsprint or other formats in a subject file, use folder inserts to segregate the photographs. Early or rare photographic formats may require additional considerations, even in a mixed format collection. Fragile photographs should always be sleeved and stored with care.

Collections of fine art photography will likely require more item level arrangement and/or description than mixed format collections. Photographs in these collections should always be sleeved and images that are too large to be sleeved should be foldered individually. Many images will likely be foldered and described individually, but it is acceptable to folder and describe groups of photographs together when appropriate (for example, images from the same session or series). These collections may contain multiple generations of an image (i.e. negatives, contact sheets, and prints). These will likely depict slightly different versions of the image and should all be retained. Depending on size and original order, the different formats may be stored together or separately. If storing them separately, take care to describe them consistently.

Photograph collections that document a particular subject or subjects and are collected specifically because they are photographs (e.g. Langmuir) may also require more item level arrangement and/or description than a mixed format collection. These are likely to contain more early photographic formats such as glass plates and albumen prints. They are also likely to contain fewer groups of photographs with a joint provenance. Most additions will be individual items acquired from a rare book and manuscript dealer. When groups of photographs with a single provenance are acquired for addition to such a collection, these may be foldered and described together. Storage of large groups of snapshots and small format prints can be improved by first placing portions of the groups in envelopes before foldering. Two envelopes will fit in one folder. Every photograph need not be sleeved in these collections. Older formats and fragile photos should always be sleeved.

For help identifying photographic formats or guidance on processing formats not mentioned here, see [Graphics Atlas](<http://www.graphicsatlas.org/> "http://www.graphicsatlas.org/"); Mary Lynn Ritzenthaler and Diane Vogt O'Connor, Photographs: Archival Care and Management; and Sylvie Pénichon, Twentieth Century Color Photographs: Identification and Care. 

### 6.3.1 General rules:

* Wash hands before handling photographic material in any format (wearing gloves is not necessary if hands are clean)
* Handle photographic material by the edges only
* Plastic sleeves are acceptable for most photographic formats except:
	* Photos with lifting emulsions or edge frills (use paper four-flap wrappers instead to minimize surface contact)
	* Unstable materials such as cellulose nitrate or cellulose acetate negatives (use paper envelopes instead) 
	* Polaroids (use paper envelopes instead)
* When sleeving, insert photographs with the emulsion layer facing away from any seams
* Sleeve items individually regardless of format
* Photographs may never be stored in glassine; when processing, photographs must be removed from any old glassine envelopes present in the collection
* Photographs can be stored upright; oversized photographs and particularly fragile photographs should be stored flat
* Like sizes should be stored together to create even pressure in boxes; if a box contains multiple sizes and materials are slumping or bending, cardboard can be inserted between folders to create more stability (consult with preservation liaison first)
* Avoid using paperclips and plastiklips on photographs whenever possible
* Folder inserts or paper envelopes can be used to keep together a subset of photographs within a folder### 6.3.2 Labeling photographs:

Labeling photographs should be rare. However, if you can identify the subject or subjects of the image and the photo is only one among many in a folder, writing the information lightly on the back of the photograph is an acceptable option.

* Place on a smooth, hard, flat surface; soft surfaces may cause impressions in the emulsion
* DO NOT use ink to label photographs, even supposedly archival pens marketed for photograph labeling
* Use a #2 pencil or softer or a Stabilo all graphite pencil
* Write lightly on the back of the image along the border only
* Exerting too much pressure will damage the emulsion
* Resin coated (RC) photo papers will not accept pencil; use paper or folder inserts to record any annotations
* DO NOT mark transparencies, direct positives, film negatives, or cased images
* Enclose the information in brackets to indicate it is archivist supplied information

### 6.3.3 Describing photographs: 

* Archivist devised titles should include:
	* Main subjects depicted, i.e., persons, events, activities, and objects
	* Geographical location, if known and significant
	* Date or date spans of what is being depicted 
	* Photographer, if known 
* Transcribe photographer supplied titles when describing fine art photographs (further description can be provided in a file level scope and content note if warranted)
* For images in photograph collections such as Langmuir (i.e., description is primarily item level and photographs are often unidentifiable by archivists), provide as much description for unidentified images as possible
	* For example, "Food service or domestic worker holding a kitten…"
	* Depending on the collection, you may also consider including race and gender information in the title
* Include format in the description when relevant (when describing early photographic processes or other rare formats)
* It is not necessary to include measurements/dimensions

### 6.3.4 19th Century paper prints:

* Should be sleeved
* DO NOT attempt to remove an image from its mount
* Unmounted albumen prints are prone to curling and cupping; insert an alkaline board behind the image inside the plastic sleeve to provide adequate support

### 6.3.5 Glass and metal plates:

* If uncased, store in a four-flap wrapper
* Store upright on long edge
* DO NOT store glass plates flat
* DO NOT allow to slant
* DO NOT touch the image layer
* DO NOT attempt to clean, repair, or flatten glass or metal plates
* Boxes that contain a significant number of glass plates should be marked as heavy and fragile

### 6.3.6 Color photographs:

* Color photographs are highly unstable and subject to color loss even in the dark
* Most color photographs can be stored according to the general rules above
* Polaroids should be stored in unbuffered envelopes rather than plastic (regular acid-free folders are on the high end of the appropriate pH for Polaroids; if not sleeving images individually, they should still be stored in an unbuffered envelope inside a folder)

### 6.3.7 Photograph albums:

* Photo albums should not be dismantled unless photographs have already started to release from pages
* If dismantling an album, take care to keep photographs in order using envelopes or folder inserts
* If pages have been disbound but photographs are still adhered, sleeve the individual pages and then folder or box as a unit
* Small albums that will fit in a folder may be stored in a Hollinger box or record center carton (preferably spine down)
* Larger albums should be stored flat in a box no more than one inch larger than the album on either side (see Head of Collection Processing to order boxes that will fit if none are on hand)

### 6.3.8 Slides and transparencies:

* Slide is usually the original negative
* Store in plastic slide pages
* If collection contains a significant number of slides, acid free three-ring binder boxes can be used for permanent storage

### 6.3.9 Negatives:

* Negatives can be sleeved in plastic
* Follow the general guidance for deciding to sleeve photographs when deciding whether or not to sleeve negatives

### 6.3.10 Nitrate film:

* Should be stored at temps below 50 with a RH of 30-40% at minimum
* Should always be stored in paper to prevent build-up of unstable gasses

### 6.3.11 Cellulose acetate film:

* Cellulose acetates shrink as they age and display vinegar syndrome
* Cellulose acetates should also be stored in alkaline buffered paper envelopes or sleeves and placed in cold storage
