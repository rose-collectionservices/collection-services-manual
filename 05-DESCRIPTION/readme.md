"Description is the creation of an accurate representation of…archival material by the process of capturing, collating, analyzing, and organizing 
information that serves to identify archival material and to explain the context and records systems that produced it, as well as the results of these 
processes."<a href="#anchor1"><sup>1</sup></a>  Description applies to both the archival material and the creators of archival material and reflects the relationships between the 
creator and the collection, materials within collections, and collections within repositories.  Description reflects both physical and intellectual 
arrangement but is not always an exact representation of that arrangement (for example, correspondence may be arranged at the item level but described at 
the folder level, or materials may be arranged at the box level and described at the item level).  Rose Library description follows guidelines established 
by Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS).

Finding aids are the most common form of description in the Rose Library, but description also refers to accession records, catalog records, and additional 
inventories/descriptions created by curators, dealers, donors, or appraisers during the acquisition process.  Description may be more or less detailed 
depending on the level of arrangement, the conditions under which a collection is being arranged, and the level of description that is sufficient to 
provide meaningful access to users.  For collections processed as part of accessioning work, description will likely be brief and general; the goal is to 
facilitate a basic level of access through minimal description.  For collections that are selected as annual processing priorities (or for small 
collections that can be fully processed during accessioning), description will be much more detailed and may include more complex structures, such as 
series and sub-series.

Collection level description is required for all collections, including a complete descriptive summary and complete administrative information, brief 
Biographical or Historical and Scope and Content Notes, and a box level inventory.  More detailed information can be provided for minimally processed 
collections at the archivist's discretion.  For collections processed at the series, folder/file, or item levels, longer Biographical/Historical Notes and 
Scope and Contents notes are necessary.  You may also include additional information in the Processing and Custodial History Notes, and create or refer to 
more detailed inventories.

Description can occur at multiple levels within collections and within series.  Certain materials, such as sound and video recordings, require item level 
description for access.  Other materials, such as newspaper clippings, do not require much description at all due to being commonly available outside an 
archive.  It may also be prudent to focus descriptive efforts on components of a collection that are reflective of the Rose Library's collecting policies, 
have high research value, are especially complex or idiosyncratic, or particularly illuminate something important about the creator.  Conversely, other 
components of the collection may receive less description.  This is at the archivist's discretion and should be explained in the processing note. 

## 5.1 Finding Aids

### 5.1.1 Main Entry/Creator

**DACS Chapter 2.6:**

Identifies the corporate bodies, persons, and families associated with the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials 
being described so that they might be appropriately documented and used to create access points by which users can search for and retrieve descriptive 
records.

**Required:** Required at the collection level.

The main entry heading is the main identity statement for the creator of the collection.  It is a primary access point for the collection.  There can be 
only one main entry heading.  Select as the creator the person, organization, agency, conference, or meeting that is primarily responsible for the creation 
of the material.  If multiple entities are equally responsible for creating the material, select the most recent creator, the creator who is most notable, 
or the creator who best represents Rose Library collecting areas (additional creators can be reflected in the title statement). 

Generally, the following types of collections will be entered under the heading for a person:

*	The personal papers of an individual, two or more individuals, or a family.
*	Artificial collections assembled by an individual (in which case the term "collector" is added to the heading).
*	An individual manuscript, letter, diary, etc.

Generally, the following types of collections will be entered under the heading for a corporation:

*	The corporate records of a single corporate body.
*	Individual official or government documents.

Generally, the following types of collections will be entered under the title statement (no main entry; this is the only exception to the requirement of 
this element) <a href="#anchor2"><sup>2</sup></a>

*	Artificial collections compiled by Rose Library.

When the Library of Congress has already established an authorized form of a creator's name, use that as the main entry exactly as established by LoC, even 
though it may be missing information.  If there is not a Library of Congress heading, follow the rules established by DACS and RDA to form the heading.  
Generally, the form of the name used should be the most common name by which a person or entity was known.  For individuals, this may be the name the 
person used to publish literary works.  For those who are not well known by a particular version of their name, use the fullest form of their name 
possible, including middle names or initials and birth or death dates when known. For companies or other organizations, the proper form of the name may be 
found on incorporation documents, financial records, letterhead, or other business records.  Corporate bodies can also include a geographic designation to 
distinguish them from other entities.

These guidelines are presented in their most basic form and there are always exceptions.  Consult with other archivists and/or the Rare Book Cataloger if 
necessary.  The Rare Book Cataloger can also establish headings through the Library of Congress when appropriate.

**Examples:**

| ﻿Individuals                                |                                         |

### 5.1.2 Title Statement

The title statement records the title of the collection and the dates of coverage of the collection.

### 5.1.2.1 Title

**DACS Chapter 2.3:**

Provides a word or phrase by which the material being described is known or can be identified.

**Required:**  Required at all levels.  

The title best describes the contents of the collection, including the creator and a brief statement of the nature of the materials.  Always repeat the 
name of the creator as part of the collection title.  If a collection contains the administrative records of an organization or corporate body, use the 
term "records."  If a manuscript collection contains a variety of materials belonging to an individual or family, use the term "papers."  If the 
collection is artificially created by an individual or by the Rose Library, use the term "collection."  If the collection consists of a single record type 
or is overwhelmingly dominated by a single record type, use a term that describes the record type.  Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns in the title. Titles where married (or otherwise partnered) couples share a last name are represented in the title by their first names with the last name used only once as in the example, "John and Mary Smith."

**Examples:**

| ﻿Collection level                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| Rebecca Ranson papers                            |
| Horace Mann and Julia W. Bond family papers      |
| Southern Christian Leadership Conference records |
| Sol Singer collection of Philatelic Judaica      |
| Literary miscellany collection                   |
| Jim Alexander photographs                        |
| James Burton diary                               |


At the series and subseries levels, the title statement must also include a description of the record types represented.  

**Examples:**

| Series/sub-series level         |
|---------------------------------|
| Office of the President records |
| Personal papers                 |
| Correspondence                  |
| Subject files                   |


Folder titles may be formal or devised by the archivist. Formal titles are those transcribed from the original folder or directly from the material itself 
(e.g., the formal title of a published work). Devised titles are those created by the archivist to best describe the material within the folder. See also: 
Processing Note and Style Guide for additional guidance on folder titles.

### 5.1.2.2 Date

**DACS Chapter 2.4:**

Identifies and records the date(s) that pertain to the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials being described.

**Required:** Required at all levels.

The date statement reflects the entire span of time during which a collection (or component of a collection) was created, accumulated, and maintained by 
the creator.  It should be repeated at every level of the finding aid.  Dates may be inclusive, approximate, predominant (bulk), or single.  

For inclusive dates, use the years only.  For single dates, use the year alone unless describing a single item, in which case use the year followed by the 
month and day.  If the exact date or dates are unknown, use approximate dates, indicated by "circa."  If the collection has large concentrations of 
material during a particular time period, use bulk dates in parentheses after the inclusive dates.  Bulk dates are useful when the span of a collection 
covers a broad range but the majority of the collection is concentrated within a smaller time period.  For example, when the earliest date is outside the 
life of the organization or when the volume of material within the bulk dates is considerably greater than the rest of the collection.

### 5.1.3 Extent

**DACS Chapter 2.5:**

Indicates the extent and the physical nature of the materials being described. This is handled in two parts, a number (quantity in linear feet) and a container summary specifying the material types.

**Required:** Required at the collection level only.  

This field describes the collection's linear footage, number of boxes, extent of oversized material, number of boxes of audiovisual material, and bytes of 
data and/or extent of physical media for born digital content.  

**Extent Subrecord in ArchivesSpace:**

*	Portion = Whole
*	Number = [Enter number of total linear feet of ALL containers, as calculated automatically by ArchivesSpace.]
*	Type = Linear Feet
*	Container Summary = [In parentheses list number of boxes, oversized papers boxes, etc. When you calculate extent in ArchivesSpace, it will automatically count the total number of containers in the container summary. You must manually edit the container summary field to reflect the guidelines below, in which other material types are subtracted from the total number of containers.]

**Examples of Container Summaries:**

*	(43 boxes)
*	(3 oversized papers box and 1 oversized papers folder (OP))
*	(4 extra-oversized papers (XOP))
*	(2 bound volumes (BV))
*	(2 oversized bound volumes (OBV))
*	(2 microfilm reels (MF))
*	(1 framed item (FR))
*	(3 AV Masters (AV))
*	(5.8 megabytes (484 files) born digital material (3 BD boxes))

### 5.1.4 Abstract

**DACS Chapter:**  None.

**Required:**  Required at the collection level.

This field is a one or two sentence summary of the collection contents.  Include the creator's name, a brief description of them that indicates why the 
Rose Library has the collection, and a list of record types or subjects present in the collection (e.g., the series titles or headers used to organize the 
collection).  It may duplicate, with slight changes, the first sentence or two of the collection level scope and content note.  It should follow the order 
[Content descriptor from title statement] of [description of person] [person] including [type(s) of material]. 

**Examples:**

*	Papers of African American businessman, educator, and politician, Michael Lomax, including personal and professional papers, printed material, 
	photographs, audiovisual material, and born digital material.

**DACS Chapter 4.5:**

Identifies the language(s), script(s), and symbol systems employed in the materials being described, particularly as they may affect its use.

**Required:** Required at the collection level.  

This field must describe the primary language or languages of the collection contents but need not list every language present if there are only small 
amounts of material in those languages.  

**Examples:**

*	Materials entirely in English.
*	Materials in English and French.
*	Materials primarily in English with some material in Dutch.

### 5.1.6 Conditions Governing Access

This field is a combination of two DACS elements: Conditions Governing Access and Physical Access.

### 5.1.6.1 Conditions Governing Access

**DACS Chapter 4.1:** 

Provides information about access restrictions due to the nature of the information in the materials being described, such as those imposed by the donor, 
by the repository, or by statutory/regulatory requirements.

**Required:** Required at the collection level.  Required at the series, sub-series, or file level when restrictions on those components are present.  

This field should note whether there are or are not any access related restrictions on the collection.  It must provide information about what is 
restricted, the date the restriction will expire, and the reason for the restriction (e.g., the restriction is legally mandated by FERPA, donor imposed, 
imposed by the archivist due to confidential third party information, etc.). This information could be provided in part by pointing to an access policy 
like the one used by University Archives (see below).  It should also record when a restriction has been lifted (including a date).

**Standard note** (all finding aids must include this note at the collection level when no restrictions are present): 

*	Unrestricted access

When describing restrictions, precede the first restriction note with "Special restrictions apply:."  Subsequent notes may follow without the prefix.

**Examples:**

*	[Description of item] is restricted until [date].
*	Series 1: Correspondence, financial records, and some family papers are closed to patrons until 2066.
*	Folders containing student materials are restricted in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) until [date].
*	At the donor's request, all financial records and journals are restricted until January 1, 2030.
*	Series 2: Financial records, contains a significant amount of confidential information about third parties. As a result, and in accordance to the Rose 
	Library's policy on confidential information, the series is closed to researchers until January 1, 2050.
*	Prior restrictions on Series 1: Correspondence expired on May 11, 2017.

The University Archives Access Policy provides further information about embargo periods for certain types of record (including financial, medical, student, and personnel records): http://rose.library.emory.edu/documents/university-archives/eua-access-policy.pdf.

When applicable, the following language is used for EUA use restriction notes:

*	Unprocessed collection. Collection is closed to research in accordance with Emory University Archives Access Policy for unprocessed materials.
*	Selected materials are closed to research in accordance with the Emory University Archives Access Policy for Board of Trustees records.
*	Selected materials are closed to research in accordance with the Emory University Archives Access Policy for Office of the President records.
*	Selected materials are closed to research in accordance with the Emory University Archives Access Policy for personnel records.
*	Selected materials are closed to research in accordance with the Emory University Archives Access Policy for student educational records.
*	Selected materials are closed to research in accordance with the Emory University Archives Access Policy for financial records.
*	Selected materials are closed to research in accordance with the Emory University Archives Access Policy for medical and patient/client records.

**Corresponding MARC field:** 506

**Corresponding EAD element(s):** ``<accessrestrict></accessrestrict>``

**Conditions Governing Access note field in ArchivesSpace:**

*	The Conditions Governing Access note is used for both information about access restrictions due to the nature of the information in the materials being described and for information about physical access restrictions, with no distinction between the two.
*	Each note field should be preceded by "Special restrictions apply:" before the content of the note.
*	Standard informational notes can be added in a single note field, with a space in between notes, unless the note requires the system to take a separate action (i.e. restrict items until a particular date).
*	If the note requires the system to take action to impose restrictions and make containers unrequestable (i.e. you are selecting that the local access restriction type is "Restricted"), then that note needs to be in a separate Conditions Governing Access note field. This will allow the system or the archivist to more easily delete those notes when the restrictions have expired.
*	Collection level notes are also displayed at the series/subseries/file leve in ASpace in the public user interface, so there is no need to repeat collection level notes at lower hierarchical levels.  
*	A Conditions Governing Access note that requires system action needs to be added at the appropriate hierarchical level, since it will apply to all series/subseries/files beneath that level. For example, a restriction that makes items unrequestable at the series level will apply to all subseries and files in that series. At the collection or series level there may be a Conditions Governing Access note that contains general information about restrictions (with a local access restriction type of unrestricted), while at the subseries or file level there may be an additional separate Conditions Governing Access note that is actionable to make those specific containers unrequestable (with a local access restriction type of restricted--see examples below).
  
*	Field specifics
	*  	Type = Conditions Governing Access
	*  	Label = [none] [*Notes that were migrated contain a label of "Restrictions on Access." You do not need to manually enter this label. Ideally these labels will be removed by script at some point in the future.]
	*	Publish = [box should be checked]
	*	Select the local access restriction type:
  		*  Select "Restricted" for the system to restrict that collection/AO and make it unrequestable.
   		*  Select nothing if there are no actionable restrictions that require items to be unrequestable.
	* 	Restriction Begin = [leave blank unless necessary to add]
	* 	Restriction End = [enter date]

**Examples of ArchivesSpace Conditions Governing Access notes:**

*Figure 7 (below): Example of a collection level Conditions Governing Access note with donor restrictions, which does not require the system to take action at the collection level. All AOs below this level would still be requestable unless there were other restrictions.*
*![Figure7](/05-DESCRIPTION/Images/Figure7.JPG "Example of a collection level Conditions Governing Access note with donor restrictions, which does not require the system to take action at the collection level. All AOs below this level would still be requestable unless there were other restrictions.")


*Figure 8 (below): Example of a series level Conditions Governing Access note with donor restrictions (with no end date for restrictions, which is not ideal). This note would make all AOs and containers in this series unrequestable.*

![Figure9](/05-DESCRIPTION/Images/Figure9.JPG "Example of a file level Conditions Governing Access note for privacy reasons. This note would restrict that AO and make that container unrequestable.")



### 5.1.6.2 Physical Access

**DACS Chapter 4.2:**

Provides information about physical access restrictions due to physical characteristics or storage locations that limit, restrict, delay, or otherwise 
affect access to the materials being described.

**Required:** Required, when applicable, at the collection level.  Required at the series and sub-series levels when restrictions on those components are 
present.

This field identifies collections that are stored off-site, collections in which audiovisual materials are not yet digitized, and collections in which 
born-digital materials are not yet processed.  It also provides instructions for requesting access to such materials.  This field notes where researchers 
are asked to access surrogate copies of materials rather than the originals (e.g., photocopies, microfilm, digitized copies) and explains why.  It must 
also identify materials that require special handling that goes beyond standard reading room policies. 

**Examples of notes that must be used verbatim:**

*	Collection stored off-site; materials must be requested two business days in advance of appointment.
*	Use copies have not been made for audiovisual material in this collection. Researchers must contact the Rose Library at least two weeks in advance for 
	access to these items. Collection restrictions, copyright limitations, or technical complications may hinder the Rose Library's ability to provide 
	access to audiovisual material.
*	Researchers must contact the Rose Library in advance for access to unprocessed born digital materials in this collection. Collection restrictions, 
	copyright limitations, or technical complications may hinder the Rose Library's ability to provide access to unprocessed born digital materials.
*	Use of the original digital media is restricted.
*	Access to born digital materials is only available in the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library.
*	Due to technical complications, the Rose Library is currently unable to provide access to remaining unprocessed born digital materials.

**Other examples:**

*	Due to the fragile nature of the material, some of the scrapbooks (OBV1-4) are closed to researchers.
*	For preservation reasons, researchers are encouraged to use the digital collection to access the majority of the photographs in Series 1 rather than 
	the original images.
*	Due to the fragile nature of some items in this collection, they may only be exposed to light for short amounts of time. Researchers will be asked to 
	limit the amount of time that they spend with such items.

**Corresponding MARC field:**  506

**Corresponding EAD element(s):** ``<accessrestrict></accessrestrict>``

**Conditions Governing Access note field in ArchivesSpace:**

*	See instructions for this note field above under 5.1.6.1 Conditions Governing Access. The Conditions Governing Access note is used for both information about access restrictions due to the nature of the information in the materials being described and for information about physical access restrictions, with no distinction between the two.
	

**Examples of ArchivesSpace Conditions Governing Access notes:**

*Figure 10 (below): Example of a collection level Conditions Governing Access note with standard notes, which does not require the system to take action at the collection level. All AOs below this level would still be requestable unless there were other restrictions.*
*![Figure10](/05-DESCRIPTION/Images/Figure10.JPG "Example of a collection level Conditions Governing Access note with standard notes, which does not require the system to take action at the collection level. All AOs below this level would still be requestable unless there were other restrictions.")

### 5.1.13 Separated Materials

This field identifies materials that have been physically removed from the collection and are being managed separately, such as rare books that have been cataloged, new collections that were created, or collection that include materials held by another Emory entity.  Always include this when books have been removed, even though they may not be cataloged immediately.  When creating a new manuscript collection from material removed from an existing collection, always include a separated materials note in the finding aid for the original collection and a custodial history note in the finding aid for the new collection. 

**Examples:**

* The Rose Library holds books formerly owned by James Amos Porter. These materials may be located in the Emory University online catalog by searching for: Porter, James Amos, former owner. Among these is the rare The Gilly Willies (Hamburg, 1960), written and illustrated by Porter's student, Mildred Thompson. 
* The May Miller papers were originally received as part of this collection and separated to form their own collection due to their size, research value, and distinct provenance.
* The C.W. Stibbe papers were initially receieved by the Michael C. Carlos Museum as part of their acquisition of sherds which are still housed at the museum.

### 5.1.14 Immediate Source of Acquisition

**DACS Chapter 5.2:**

Identifies the source from which the repository directly acquired the materials being described, as well as the date of acquisition, the method of acquisition, and other relevant information. 

**Required:** Required at the collection level. 

The source note should always include the method by which a collection was acquired, who it was acquired from (in as much detail as appropriate), and the year acquired.  If the source is an individual (or individuals), full names are preferred. In cases where the initial information is not included, update additions to the collection with the full name (e.g. 2022 additions were a gift from (name). There will be some mixed descriptive practice on many of the older finding aids for collections with additions over the years, but use current practice for any new additions.

The source field only describes the transaction by which the library receives materials. The custodial history note can be used to provide information about the history of the collection beyond the immediate source from which the library acquired the material.  The custodial history note is also the appropriate place to note the relationship between the creator of a collection and the source from which we acquired it.   

Gift, Purchase, and Transfer are the three main ways that the Rose Library acquires collections. Below are sub-categories that acknowledge the types of transactions in each category.  

| ﻿Gift sub-categories: | Purchase sub-categories:                                                                                                     | Transfer sub-categories:                            |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Gift of the Estate   | Purchase from Individual                                                                                                     | Transferred from another institution                |
| Gift of the Family   | Purchase from Dealer (We use the name of the business rather than the individual.  This should be reflected on the invoice.) | Transferred from an Emory University office or unit |
| Gift of Individual   | Purchase via Broker on behalf of another individual                                                                          |                                                     |

**Examples:**

* Gift of Beth Remmes, 2017 
* Gift of the Estate of John Doe, 1987

### 5.1.15 Custodial History

**DACS Chapter 5.1:**

Provides information on changes of ownership or custody of the material being described, from the time it left the possession of the creator until it was acquired by the repository, that is significant for its authenticity, integrity, and interpretation. 

**Required:** Optional. Preferred when applicable. 

This field is used in conjunction with the Source note (see [5.1.14 Immediate source of acquisition](#5114-immediate-source-of-acquisition) for more information) to describe the provenance of the collection from the point at which the material left the possession of the creator until it was arrived at the Rose. It may include:

* The physical location and storage conditions of the collection between creation and donation, including dates if known; 
* People or institutions acting on the records and the actions that they took, when that information can be made public; 
* Who packed the collection and prepared it for shipment; 
* Third party intermediaries involved in mediating the collection in any way; 
* Archivist or curator involvement in transfer of material.  

This note should be used whenever the collection is not a straightforward transfer directly from the records creator.  The note should provide as much information as can be made public, including contextual information. 

**Examples:**

* Purchased from a dealer; provenance and custodial history unknown. 
* The Rose Library purchased this collection from book dealer Glenn Horowitz in 2010. The original owner bought it in the early 1970s as the unknown contents of a trunk sold at an auction of abandoned items from a storage facility in Wellfleet, Massachusetts. During the 1960s, Brennan spent her summers in the town. 
* Purchased from Douglas Turner Ward in 2017. The collection was packed and prepared for transfer from Douglas Turner Ward's home to the Rose Library by the staff of the Boo Hooray Gallery in New York City in 2016. 
* The Eugene Patterson papers were given by the Patterson family to the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which then held, organized, and preserved the papers until their transfer to Emory University in 2016.

### 5.1.16 Citation

**DACS Chapter 7.1:**

Indicates the preferred style for the citation of the unit being described. 

**Required:** Required at the collection level.   

This field includes the Rose Library's preferred citation for the collection.  The citation only includes a description of the item and the title of the collection.  It does not include the manuscript number, or box and folder numbers.  Do not include dates in the title statement as dates are subject to change after detailed processing or as additions are accrued.   

[identification of item(s)], [title statement], Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library, Emory University 

**Example:**

* [after identification of item(s)], Alli Royce Soble photographs, Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library, Emory University. 

**Corresponding MARC field:**  524

**Corresponding EAD element(s):** ``<prefercite></prefercite>``

### 5.1.17 Processing Note

**DACS Chapter 7.1:**

Provides information about actions of the archivist, custodians, or creators of the records or conventions in the finding aid that may have an impact on a researcher’s interpretation of the records or understanding of the information provided in the finding aid.   

**Required:** Required at the collection level and may be repeated at the series and subseries level.  The information provided may be more or less detailed depending on the complexity of the collection and the depth of the archivist's intervention.   

The information provided in this field is iterative.  The archivist should add to the note each time significant arrangement and description is done on all or part of the collection.  Always retain previous information.  At minimum, the processing note should include the level of arrangement and description, the names of individuals involved in processing, the names of individuals who wrote the finding aid (if different than those who did the arrangement), and the date(s) of arrangement and description.  The note should also include information about original order and whether or not the archivist imposed the organization, as well as any significant information about creator supplied folder titles or archivist devised folder titles.  The note may include information about preservation work done on the collection such as refoldering and rehousing, preservation photocopying, sleeving photographs, or more significant conservation.  If container numbers have been altered in any way, for example a numbered box becomes an AV masters box, this information must be included in the processing note. 

For born digital material, include information about transfer of the data, reformatting that was done, if data could not be captured or retained and why (virus, etc.), and redaction of personally identifiable information (PII).  Describe any information that may affect a patron's understanding of the files, such as the fact that migration to PDF always changes the file dates, and point out any efforts made to provide original metadata.   

Processing notes are used at the series and/or subseries level when it is necessary to describe processing decisions made specifically for that component that go beyond the decisions described in the collection level note.  Series level notes are typically more detailed, especially for born digital material.  This field can be used to describe any reformatting of audiovisual material or to describe how archivists distinguished between types of material (such as personal and professional correspondence). 

**Examples:**

*Basic notes:*

* Arranged and described at the folder level by Haylee Harrell, Ingrid Meintjes, and Sarah Quigley, 2017. 
* Arranged and described at the folder level by Sarah Quigley, Ingrid Meintjes, and Allison Pilatsky, 2015. Born digital materials processed by Dorothy Waugh, January, 2016. 

*Information about original order and/or archivist imposed organization:*

* The collection arrived at the Rose Library in no discernible order. Meaghan O'Riordan aggregated the records by record type during accessioning.   
* The organization of this collection was primarily devised by Sarah Quigley and Rebecca Sherman during processing in 2012.  However, the collected poetry subseries (2.1a) reflects a combination of Grennan's original order and archivist imposed arrangement.  The collected poetry was arranged by archivists in chronological order by publication date.  Grennan frequently changed the title of a collection during the process of compiling and revising the typescript. Typescripts with these variant titles have been arranged by archivists in alphabetical order within each work, with different drafts in chronological order to the extent that could be determined.  Material for collected works also include working files that contain poems considered for publication in that work but which ultimately were not included.  Some also include working files titled "Towards [work]," as labeled by Grennan.  The original arrangement of these folders has been retained to preserve evidence of early drafting efforts. Many poems in the subseries have multiple drafts which may be located with typescripts of a complete work, working files, and the folder for that individual poem. Not all collected works contain all of these materials. 
* Processed by Sarah Quigley, October 2015. Photograph album descriptions in the container list are copied from the inside covers of each album. Information not included on the covers was provided by Randy Gue, the curator who acquired the collection and is indicated by brackets. Names, titles, locations, and dates have not been checked for accuracy.  Born digital materials processed by Dorothy Waugh, December 2015. Files have been organized according to the event that they document. File names and dates last modified have not been changed. 
* Material arrived at the Rose Library organized broadly by subject by the donor.  Rose Staff retained these categories.
* The collection arrived at Rose Library primarily in labeled folders but with limited organization; archivists devised the arrangement, refoldered materials, foldered loose items, and provided or clarified folder titles. Archivists left photographs in the folders or context in which they were found; loose photographs were interfiled by subject. 

*Information about preservation actions:*

* During arrangement, archivists refoldered and reboxed the collection material into acid free archival folders and boxes.  We removed and discarded original binders, making photocopies of any information written or adhered to the binders themselves. We also made preservation photocopies of all thermal faxes. 
* Emory Libraries conservation staff conducted extensive conservation work on the scrapbooks in this collection, including dry cleaning throughout the text block, mending, flattening, and removal of pressure sensitive tape and staples.  A detailed conservation report is available from the repository. 

*Collection level born digital processing note:*

* Born digital materials processed by Dorothy Waugh, January 2016. The born digital materials currently available to researchers include files taken from two of Natasha Trethewey's personal laptops, a Dell Latitude D800 and a Dell Latitude X300. For information as to how these materials were processed, see the processing note in the description of series 7, Born digital materials. 

*Series level born digital processing note:*

* The born digital materials currently available to researchers are from two of Trethewey's laptop computers, a Dell Latitude D800 and a Dell Latitude X300. Individual files from both computers were extracted from forensic images of the hard drives and were scanned for viruses using McAfee's anti-virus software. Text-based files were migrated to PDF and image files to JPEG to create access copies. Files have been screened for private information. Files have been organized into five series matching the arrangement of the collection's paper component: 1) Correspondence and personal papers; 2) Writings by Trethewey; 3) Writings by others; 4) Printed material; and 5) Photographs. File and directory names were maintained and the original directory structure has been replicated. In cases where Natasha Trethewey originally grouped files into directories by book title or project, the complete directory will be located in the most relevant series. When necessary, a Writings by others folder was added to distinguish writings from Trethewey's own work when this is otherwise unclear.

### 5.1.18 Appraisal Note

**DACS Chapter 5.3:**

Provides information about the rationale for appraisal decisions, destruction actions, and disposition schedules that are relevant to the understanding and use of the materials being described.

**Required:** Required at collection level.  Repeatable at subsequent levels as appropriate.   

Rose Library appraisal notes must contain: 

* who collected the material, their title, and as part of which collecting area; 
* if material has been removed or not; 
	  * If material has been removed, the note must specify what has been removed, the extent of removed material, justification for removal, disposition, and the names of key decision makers (generally a combination of an archivist, a curator, and the Head of Collection Services); 
* if the Rose Library's purpose in acquiring a collection is to document one specific activity or aspect of a person or organization. When that is the case we should document that our selection and appraisal decisions were made with the intention of documenting key areas/functions/activities of a creator's life, and that material that does not reflect those areas has been removed from the collection. 
 
Examples below are for the most common kinds of appraisal notes and are listed in the order in which they should generally be presented.  Several of these clauses may need to be strung together to create a complete Appraisal Note.  Examples of complex, multi-part appraisal notes are available at the end of this section.

### 5.1.19 Biographical/Historical Note

**DACS Chapter 2.7:**

Describes the required elements of a biographical or administrative history note about creators embedded in the description of materials. The administrative/biographical history provides relevant information about corporate bodies, persons, or families who are identified using the Name of Creator(s) Element and who therefore function as nominal access points. This element also describes the relationship of creators to archival materials by providing information about the context in which those materials were created. 

**Required:** Required at the collection level.   

The note contains brief and concise information about the collection creator and is compiled through a combination of information contained in the collection and outside research.  A biographical note should include descriptions of the creator's life and accomplishments with special attention paid to details that relate to Rose Library collecting areas.  It is appropriate to include short biographies of multiple individuals when it is important to the collection, for example when multiple people's papers are present or the creator has collected materials relating to another (see: Martha Dow Fehsenfeld collection of Samuel Beckett letters).   

Biographical notes should include: 

* Full name, married name, and pseudonyms/pen names;
* Life dates and places of birth and death
* Family information, including parents, spouses or partners, and children;
* Occupations and other significant professional or extra-curricular activities and achievements (volunteering, community service, etc.);
* Education;
* Other significant relationships.

Historical notes contain a brief overview of the evolution and development of a business or corporate body.  They should include: 

* The official name of the organization and any history of name changes;
* Location of the organization and any significant relocations/moves;
* Dates of establishment and dissolution (if applicable);
* Primary functions and mission of the organization; 
* Names of organizational leaders and other significant people involved with the organization, particularly those documented in the collection;
* Organizational structure, especially as it relates to/illuminates the arrangement of the collection.

The tone of these notes should be informational and avoid judgments about the value or importance of the creator's life and/or work.  Notes should be only as lengthy as necessary to convey the most important information about the creator and should focus on aspects of their life or history that directly relate to the contents of the collection.  They are meant to illuminate the ways in which the records in the collection were created, compiled, and used by an individual or organization.  It is not necessary to include every element of a biography or history.  If the creator is especially well known, notes can be shorter since information about the creator is readily available elsewhere.  For large and particularly complex collections, it may be necessary to include biographical or historical notes at the series level.  This will be rare, but can allow for a shorter overview at the collection level and more specific information at the series level where it's most relevant (see: [Southern Christian Leadership Conference records](<http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/90wfs> "http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/90wfs")). 

**Example of good biographical note:** [Richard Blanco papers](<https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/blanco1431/> "https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/blanco1431/") 
**Example of good historical note:**  [Druid Hills Civic Association records](<https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/druid65/> "https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/druid65/")

### 5.1.20 Scope and Content Note

**DACS Chapter 3.1:**

Provides information about the nature of the materials and activities reflected in the unit being described to enable users to judge its potential relevance. 

**Required:** Required at the collection, series, and sub-series level.  Optional at the folder level.

The Scope and Content Note is a narrative summary of the contents of the collection or a component part of the collection.  The note should apply generally to all of the records/documents contained within the portion of the collection being described.  It should also note any particular weaknesses in the collection or the absence of material that patrons might otherwise reasonably expect to find (e.g., the absence of Black Panther records in the Elaine Brown papers). 

The collection level scope and content note must include an introductory sentence followed by specific information about record types, subjects covered, functions documented, major correspondents, and other significant people, places, and events documented by the collection.  When writing a scope note, it is important to anticipate subject cataloging.  Any names, places, or topics that receive controlled headings MUST be present in the scope and content note.  The length of the scope and content note should be proportional to the size and complexity of the collection or collection component.  An average sized collection should not require more than two strong paragraphs, while a very large collection with a complicated arrangement may require closer to a full page.  Notes for collections that include series must contain information about each series.      

Scope and Content Notes are also required at every series and sub-series level.  The structure is similar, but lower level notes contain more specific information about the materials in that component.  For collections with sub-series, the series level notes must include information about each component sub-series.   

This note is repeatable at the folder level and can be used to present important information specific to that folder or item that is not appropriate for a higher level note.  See figure 1 for an example:   

![Figure 1: Sample folder level scope and content note](/05-DESCRIPTION/Images/Figure1.jpg "Sample folder level scope and content note")

*Figure 1: Sample folder level scope and content note*

**Example of good series/sub-series level scope and content note:** [Natasha Trethewey papers, Series 7: Born Digital materials](<https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/trethewey1272/series7/> "https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/trethewey1272/series7/")

### 5.1.21 Arrangement Note

**DACS Chapter 3.2:**

Describes the current organization of the collection. 

**EAD Tag Library definition:** Information on how the described materials have been subdivided into smaller units, e.g., record groups into series, identifying the logical or physical groupings within a hierarchical structure. Can also be used to express the filing sequence of the described materials, such as the principle characteristics of the internal structure, or the physical or logical ordering of materials, including alphabetical, chronological, geographical, office of origin, and other schemes. Identifying logical groupings and the arrangement pattern may enhance retrieval by researchers. 

**Required:** Required at collection level.  Repeatable and required at the series and sub-series levels when applicable.

The arrangement note does not include information about the archivist's actions or decisions during processing (see: [5.1.2.17 Processing Note](#51217-processing-note)). 

MARC records will require you to use "arranged" or "organized" depending on the level of description in question.  "Arranged" corresponds to the filing sequence while "organized" corresponds to the higher-lever subdivisions of the collection into hierarchical units.   

For small and/or simple collections and collections with box level inventories, the arrangement note must: 

* Describe the filing sequence used to arrange the material. 
	* Examples:
		* Arranged in alphabetical order. 
		* Arranged by record type, then in alphabetical order. 
		* Arranged in chronological order.
		* Arranged in the order in which it was recieved.  (this is used in cases, especially upon accessioning, where little or no arrangement is done)
		
If a collection is divided into series, the collection level arrangement note must: 

* Describe how the collection has been organized into units. 
	* Examples:
		* Organized into seven series: (1) Correspondence and personal papers, (2) Writings by Grennan, (3) Writings by others, (4) Diaries, (5) Printed material, (6) Photographs, and (7) Born digital materials.  
		* Organized into 21 series: (1) Board of Directors records, (2) Office of the President records, (3) Office of the Executive Vice President records, (4) Office of the Executive Director and National Administrator records, (5) Department of Chapters and Affiliates records, (6) Department of Communications records, (7) Department of Direct Action records, (8) Crisis Intervention Committee records, (9) Department of Student Affairs records, (10) Programs Department records, (11) Martin Luther King Speaks records, (12) Other department records, (13) Personnel records, (14) Financial records, (15) Southern Christian Leadership Foundation records, (16) Legal records, (17) Printed material, (18) Photographs, (19) Audiovisual, (20) Artifacts and memorabilia, and (21) Born digital materials. 

If you have arranged a collection into series, the series level arrangement note must: 

* Describe either how the series has been organized into smaller units (sub-series) or describe the filing sequence of the material. 
	* Examples if there are no sub-series: 
		* Arranged in alphabetical order. 
		* Arranged in chronological order. 
		* Arranged into two groups, correspondence and personal papers. Correspondence is arranged in chronological order and personal papers are arranged in alphabetical order. 
		* Arranged by record type.  Dated correspondence is arranged in chronological order; undated correspondence is arranged in alphabetical order by correspondent. Personal and family papers are arranged in alphabetical order. 
	* Examples if there are sub-series: 
		* Organized into five subseries: (2.1) President Martin Luther King, Jr. files, (2.2) President Ralph David Abernathy files, (2.3) President Joseph E. Lowery files, (2.4) President Martin Luther King, III files, and (2.5) President's reports. 
		* Organized into three subseries: (3.1) Poetry by Higgins, (3.2) Other writings by Higgins, and (3.3) Writings by others.  
		
If you have arranged series into sub-series, the subseries level arrangement note must follow the same rules as the series level arrangement note.  Most commonly, the note will describe the filing sequence for the subseries.  Occasionally, the complexity of the collection will require further division of the subseries into sub-subseries (we do not use this term in finding aids and we do not arrange beyond sub-subseries). 

* Examples if there are sub-subseries: 
	* Organized into three subseries: (2.1a) Collected poetry, (2.1b) Uncollected poetry, and (2.1c) Chronological poetry drafts.

### 5.1.22 Additional Finding Aids

**DACS Chapter 5.6:**

Identifies any other finding aids to the materials being described, particularly if they are available to the user, and provides information about the form and content of those finding aids. 

**Required:** Optional but preferred when applicable.

This field describes any additional finding aids, such as indexes or original inventories, created for the collection.  If used, this field is repeatable and should appear at the collection level and any relevant series or sub-series levels.  It is not necessary to use this field to indicate the presence of MARC catalog records. 

**Examples:**

* An index of respondents to the questionnaires for Horace Mann Bond's "A Study of the Factors Involved in the Identification and Encouragement of Unusual Academic Talent among Underprivileged Populations" (Project 458) is available. 
* An index to correspondence in Series 2 and to [Ralph] McGill's daily editorial columns in Series 9 is available. 
* The preliminary inventory of the Douglas Turner Ward papers, created by Boo Hooray when the collection was packed, is available.  See Rose Library staff for access. 

**Corresponding MARC field:**  555

**Corresponding EAD element(s):** ``<otherfindaid></otherfindaid>``

## 5.2 Using the Microsoft Word Template

There are three finding aids templates:  Nonseries, Series, and Subseries (F:\MARBL\Arrangement & Description Services\Forms).  When writing the finding aid, provide information in each of the required fields plus any additional optional fields that are relevant to a specific collection.  Delete fields that are not relevant.  The template includes all necessary formatting for the collection level description. 

The templates may not include all necessary formatting for container lists.  The Perl script that automatically encodes the container lists is dependent on this formatting and it must be correct for the script to run.  This formatting cannot be applied to container lists retrospectively.  If it is not set prior to beginning the container list, it will need to be applied individually to each multi-line folder title. 

* Click the arrow in the bottom right corner of the paragraph tab on the home ribbon (see figure 2);

![Figure 2: Click the arrow in the bottom right corner of the paragraph tab on the home ribbon](/05-DESCRIPTION/Images/Figure2.jpg "Click the arrow in the bottom right corner of the paragraph tab on the home ribbon")

*Figure 2*

* Set left and right indentations at 0" and special hanging indentation at 1.2" (see figure 3);
* In the bottom left of the paragraph menu, select "tabs" (see figure 3);

![Figure 3: Set left and right indentations at 0 and special hanging indentation at 1.2](/05-DESCRIPTION/Images/Figure3.jpg "Set left and right indentations at 0 and special hanging indentation at 1.2")

*Figure 3*

* Set tabs at .5" and 1" (see figure 4);

![Figure 4: Set tabs at .5 and 1](/05-DESCRIPTION/Images/Figure4.jpg "Set tabs at .5 and 1")

*Figure 4*

* Ensure that all extra tabs and spaces at the end of folder titles are deleted. 

Also change the following autoformat settings in Microsoft Word:

* Go to Options
* Go to Proofing
* Click "AutoCorrect Options"
* Under BOTH the "AutoFormat" and "AutoFormat as You Type" tabs, deselect:
	* "Straight Quotes with "Smart Quotes"
	* Ordinals (1st) with superscript
	* Fractions (1/2) with fraction character
	* Hyphens (--) with dash
	
Microsoft Word will also autoformat ellipses in a way that our perl script cannot read, but this cannot be changed in settings. When you type an ellipsis, backspace once. If this deletes the entire ellipsis, retype and backspace again. This should leave three periods that are readable by the script.


## 5.3 Reviewing and Editing Finding Aids

Finding aids go through two rounds of editing and feedback before they're published in EmoryFindingAids.  Send the draft to the Manuscript Archivists, Accessioning Archivist, and Head of Collection Services for editing.  After incorporating feedback from at least two colleagues, share the new draft with the appropriate Curator for further feedback.  Incorporate their suggestions and proceed with encoding and publishing the document.  If the Curator does not return comments within one week, publish the finding aid and incorporate any changes they suggest at a later date. 

Once the finding aid is published, send the permanent link to the donor (via email, if that information is available).  They may have additional questions about how the collection is arranged and described or factual corrections.  It is not necessary to delay publication of a finding aid in order to seek feedback from a collection donor.
   
## 5.4 Anti Oppressive Archival Description Principles and Guidelines

These guidelines for creating inclusive, anti-oppressive archival description were developed as part of a project to acknowledge and remediate harmful language in the Rose Library's archival descriptive tools. These guidelines are also intended to aid in the creation of all new archival description. This document contains rules and suggestions for describing the marginalized communities most commonly documented in Rose Library’s collections. It includes references to helpful resources for describing identities and circumstances less well-represented in our holdings.  It does not currently address the use of LCSH subject headings in finding aids. We are watching closely other initiatives in the Libraries to address subject headings and will revise our policies when we can be in alignment with them.

**Principles**

While Rose Library staff includes people of color and LGBTQIA+ people, we acknowledge that we are a staff of predominantly white, cisgender, heterosexual archivists who are responsible for describing historically underrepresented communities of which we are mostly not part. We are obligated to describe the individuals and communities documented in our collections with care and respect and to minimize as much as possible the detrimental effects of our limited and privileged experiences.  
 
The description we create reflects our institutional and professional ethics and values; centers the needs of our users and the communities we document; contributes to a welcoming and supportive environment for users; is transparent about our knowledge, expertise, and biases; and is a function of archival practice that requires continuous reflection and improvement.<a href="#anchor3"><sup>3</sup></a>
 
We include donors/creators in the creation of our description as much as possible and invite feedback and correction from user and donor communities. 

**General Guidelines**

* When choosing language, first ask yourself why you’re choosing a word or phrase and how it benefits our users. 
* When transcribing description provided by donors/creators, contextualize potentially derogatory titles made by the creator where possible by using quotation marks and writing a robust and transparent processing note that addresses the use of those terms.
* Describe creators/subjects as they describe themselves.
* Prioritize people’s humanity over their identities, occupations, or relationships.
* Default to person-first language unless you know the individual or community you’re describing prefers alternate terminology (i.e., person with a disability vs. disabled person).
* Use people’s names and do not identify them by their relationships to others alone (i.e., Jane Smith not Mrs. John Smith or the wife of John Smith).
* Be as specific as you can be (i.e., Korean not Asian).
* Do not use euphemistic language to describe difficult topics such as racist or gendered violence.
* Avoid use of the passive voice.
	
**Revision Cycle**

We are committed to regularly revising and revisiting our past description. We will undertake a systematic review of finding aids as part of the adoption of these guidelines. We will also continue our existing practice of inviting revision suggestions and reports of errors in our finding aids from users. 

We acknowledge that we are applying our 21st Century understanding of race, gender, and sexuality to groups and individuals who may not have held the same understanding. We know that there is often no way to know how a historical figure identified or was perceived in the context of their own time, place, and community.  In describing archival collections and their creators, we often make assumptions about an individual’s race or gender that may not be in line with their own self-identification. We will let information in the collections guide our description and will correct our description if/when we become aware of new information.

Additionally, preferred terminology for describing individuals or communities changes over time. The guidelines that we are recommending today may not be appropriate in the future. We will periodically review and update these guidelines to ensure that our descriptive policies reflect current best practices and meet contemporary cultural norms. 

### 5.4.1 Describing Race and Ethnicity

**Principles to Consider**

* Always identify race and ethnicity when it's known. 
* Be as specific as possible. For example, if you know an individual is Korean, describe them as such rather than using the more general term, Asian.
* Describe whiteness as you would describe the racial and ethnic identities of people of color to avoid presenting whiteness as the default and othering non-white identities. 
* Ensure your description includes terms that are acceptable within the individual's community, especially when describing individuals whose race or ethnicity is less familiar to you or underrepresented in our collections.
* When transcribing description provided by donors/creators, contextualize potentially derogatory titles made by the creator where possible by using quotation marks and writing a robust and transparent processing note that addresses the use of those terms.

**Preferred Terms**

* African American 
* Black person, always capitalized 
	* Be sensitive to possible generational or individual preferences for African American vs. Black. 
* white person, never capitalized 
* Native American, American Indian, or Indigenous American when describing groups or individuals with unknown tribal affiliation or where multiple identities are represented
	* Be sensitive to personal preference when deciding which term to use; each is acceptable within different communities but may be unacceptable in others. 
* People/person of color, when describing groups or individuals with multiple or unknown racial and ethnic identities 

**Language to Avoid**

* Caucasian has its roots in racist anthropological/scientific practices and should not be used as a synonym for white.<a href="#anchor4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
* Be careful not to automatically default to African American for creators and subjects who may identify as Caribbean American, Afro-Latinx, etc., or who may be foreign-born. 
* Do not use people/person of color when referring to one specific racial or ethnic identity. 
* Do not use outdated terms that were once acceptable, even if those terms are prevalent in the collection.
* Blacks, whites, etc.
* Consider “nation,” “language group,” or “ethnicity” instead of “tribe.”

### 5.4.2 Describing Enslavement and Colonization

**Principles to Consider**<a href="#anchor5"><sup>5</sup></a>

* Many of the Rose Library's collections documenting enslavement in the United States will do so from the perspective of the white enslavers. Make every effort to surface and highlight the records documenting enslaved persons in the collection.
* Use the names of enslaved people whenever possible.
* If you’re writing about violence, rape, assault and coercion under slavery, name that violence rather than obscuring it with euphemisms.
* North American 19th Century Black activists often were activists for decades after the Civil War. Calling them “abolitionists” is reductive and obscures the depth of their work following the Civil War. 
* Slavery was the economic foundation of every country in the Americas, not just the United States. Be specific and only use "America" when referring to the entire landmass. 
* Be specific when using the names of nations that often were not nations at the time of consideration, or at least underscore their colonial political condition until independence, i.e. abolition in Cuba does not occur until 1886, when it was still a colony of Spain. 
* Be aware of shifting allegiances with regards to national identities as claimed by the people on the ground themselves: if a child was born free in Western Africa, captured and traded to Havana, and lives the majority of his adult life in New Orleans, how would you describe him? Understand and highlight his multilingual, diasporic, multiple existence. 
* When transcribing description provided by donors/creators, contextualize potentially derogatory titles made by the creator where possible by using quotation marks and writing a robust and transparent processing note that addresses the use of those terms.

**Preferred Terms**

* Enslaved (Africans, people, mothers, workers, artisans, children, etc.)
	* Using enslaved (as an adjective) rather than “slave” (as a noun) disaggregates the condition of being enslaved with the status of “being” a slave. People weren’t slaves; they were enslaved. 
* Free (man, woman, child, person)
* Captive (Africans, fathers, families, workers, infants, etc.)
* Enslaver (rather than many of the terms below)
* Enslaved laborers instead of nannies, domestic servants 
	* Describe the type of labor they did instead of using a term that obscures their enslavement, such as "enslaved woman/man who worked as…"
	* Consider using terms such as "enslaved nanny" or "enslaved domestic servant"
* Freedom seeker instead of fugitive 
* Consider using not only the term “stolen labor,” but also “stolen labor, knowledge and skills.” 

**Language to Avoid**

* Slave master  
	* The term “master” transmits the aspirations and values of the enslaving class without naming the practices they engaged. 
* Slaveholder 
* Slave owner 
	* Alternatives: those who claimed people as property, those who held people in slavery, etc. 
* Planter (when referring to enslavers) 
* Slave mistress and enslaved mistress (to name sexual violence/relations/conditions)
	* Both terms imply romantic or consensual relationships.
* Slave concubine and enslaved concubine 
* Slave breeding/breeders (for forced reproduction) 
* Chattel
* Domestic servants 
* "Runaway slave” 
	* Alternatives: “fugitives from slavery” or “self-liberated” or “self-emancipated” individuals 
* No one was “born a slave,” instead people were born with “free” or “slave” status.
* When describing plantations, avoid valorizing and nostalgic language that obscures the realities of slavery.

### 5.4.3 Describing Sexuality

**Principles to Consider**

* Avoid framing collection description exclusively around a person’s sexual identity - their materials have historic value beyond their sexual identity. 
* Remember that language or identity can be generational; language changes over time and words used now haven't always been acceptable, i.e. queer, and words commonly used in the past may have pejorative meanings to contemporary audiences.
* Where possible have a conversation with the donor, creator, or person depicted in the materials, or other stakeholders, about how they identify and how they would prefer to be identified. Defer to that identification. If you are unable to communicate with a person directly about their identification, then defer to evidence in the collection. 
* To provide context, make it clear when a creator has used language that some people might find outdated or offensive in their materials by creating a transparent processing note and including additional notation where necessary such as quotation marks. 
* Remember that individual actions and behaviors do not always neatly correspond to a particular identity category. In cases where collections contain evidence of queer behaviors or relationships, but no evidence that the actors involved claimed a queer identity, it is preferable to describe the contents of a collection (i.e. love letters between X and Y) rather than assign an identity category to a person that may be inaccurate or inappropriate.

**Preferred Terms**

* Use language that conveys support. Using supportive language can convey to a reader that our reading room is a welcoming place for the LGBTQIA+ community. 

**Language to Avoid**

* Avoid incorporating historically derogatory terms unless the term has been expressly used, embraced, or reclaimed by the donor, creator, person, or group represented in the material as a key piece of their self-description or identity 
	* Contextualize potentially derogatory titles made by the creator where possible by using quotation marks and writing a robust and transparent processing note that addresses the use of those terms. 
* Avoid using euphemistic or silencing language that would imply non-normative sexualities are shameful or shouldn’t be stated plainly (if appropriate and respectful of how the individual identified or lived their life). Consider taking a holistic approach when giving identity to an individual. What clues are in the materials or resources used to write the finding aid that provide the needed evidence for this identification? 
* Avoid using language that assumes or frames heterosexuality as the norm or default, i.e. assuming a women’s partner is automatically a man. 
* Avoid using generalizing language that applies an individual’s identity to an entire group.

### 5.4.4 Describing Gender

**Principles to Consider**

* When a historical person’s gender identity is not known, privilege clues about gender found in contemporary sources from close friends or family rather than legal or medical descriptions.  In the absence of contemporary historical sources use your best judgment.  
* Recognize that gender presentations may change over time or manifest differently in different contexts or social groups. Use the most recent or most appropriate to the context represented in the records in your description. 
* When transcribing description provided by donors/creators, contextualize potentially derogatory titles made by the creator where possible by using quotation marks and writing a robust and transparent processing note that addresses the use of those terms.

**Preferred Terms**

* Use the gender identity and pronouns used by the individual you are describing. 
* Use they/them pronouns when describing nonbinary or gender diverse individuals whose pronouns are unknown. 
* Identify women by their given names, not their husband's names. Make every reasonable effort to identify their names if it is not obvious from the collection material. 
* Provide all relevant names in narrative description when possible; this is particularly important for individuals who may be known professionally and privately by different names (for example, maiden names and married names). 
* Only use the word transgender as an adjective. 
* Use of the singular, gender neutral pronoun "they" is acceptable.

**Language to Avoid**

* Do not refer to gender identity or pronouns as "preferred." 
* Avoid the use of the universal "he" or "man." 
* If a trans* person has transitioned and dissociated from the gender and gendered identity they were assigned at birth, do not use their dead name in the description. Refer to the individual only by the name(s) they used after transitioning.  Only use names assigned at birth with permission. 
	* If an individual's Library of Congress authorized name is still their dead name, do not use it as a main entry and talk to Beth about updating the record.
* Avoid the use of language that pathologizes trans* individuals. 


### 5.4.5 Resources
