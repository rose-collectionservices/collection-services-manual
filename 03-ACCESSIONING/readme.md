Accessioning is the formal act of taking legal and physical control of an archival or manuscript collection. Formally accessioning material helps to establish the authenticity of the material through documenting the chain of custody. It also gives the Rose Library administrative and custodial control over collections and shows that the library is acting in good faith when accepting archival material by documenting the transfer and its terms.

## 3.1 Moving from Acquisition to Accessioning

*Note: This workflow was fully implemented for Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19). Collection material received prior to FY19 will be recorded in ArchivesSpace but may not follow current process.*

There is overlap between the acquisition and accessioning workflow, but as a general rule, the Acquisition workflow is completed by the Head of Processing or University Archivist and documents the transfer of materials and the creation and signing of paperwork. 
*	Head of Processing or University Archivist makes information available to Collections Archivists through Airtable’s "Accessioning To-Be-Assigned" view.
*	Head of Processing or University Archivist will also have created a stub accessioning record in ArchivesSpace.
*	Information from curators (including notes taken by the Head of Processing during monthly Acquisition Strategies meetings) will be passed on to the Archivist responsible for that accession.
*	Information about the status of collections can be found in the Airtable "Potential and/or Not Yet Received" view.
*	Processing team members identify capacity, and the Head of Processing discusses collections that are available for accessioning. Archivists choose/are assigned collections (which are added their individual accessioning queues in Airtable) based on current workloads and specific expertise when possible. Archivists use their personal views in Airtable to access these lists.

## 3.2 Accessioning workflow
The accessioning workflow primarily focuses on systems to document the ownership and custody of collection materials through the systems of record and systems that manage them.  The system of record for accessions is [ArchivesSpace](<https://archives.libraries.emory.edu/staff)/>) and [Airtable](<https://airtable.com/appxehhHnKmdPpzld/tblVOysdj8gmTooGt/viwM1W5reGNIwQRe3?blocks=hide>) is used to manage the workflow between acquisition through accessioning. The [Acquisitions folder in Sharepoint](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions?csf=1&web=1&e=5W2pNF>) is the system of record for acquisitions paperwork, and information is linked from there to both ArchivesSpace and Airtable for access. 

The Rose Library aims to make all new acquisitions available to researchers immediately following the accessioning of collection material. Traditionally, an accession workflow does not include processing, but the Rose Library completes extensible or minimal processing at this point to make the collection discoverable and usable. More granular processing is not necessary at this time, but, at minimum, the material must be described at the box/container level. More granular processing may be done in some cases (e.g., where the collection is quite small or researcher interest is high). Therefore, while other processing workflows - creation of resource records and physical processing -  are not part of traditional accessioning, they are listed in the [3.6 Accessioning Checklist](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/blob/master/03-ACCESSIONING/readme.md#36-accessioning-checklist>) as part of the Rose Library process.  

### 3.2.1 Airtable Acquisitions and Accessioning base
The Acquisitions & Accessioning base in Airtable documents the acquisition workflow and includes records of acquisitions based on paperwork from the donor and information from the curatorial team. Airtable also tracks the stages of completion of acquisitions including their location and extent among other administrative content.

#### 3.2.1.1 Using "Views" in Airtable
Views are personalized access portals to the content of the Acquisitions & Accessioning Base.  Each view can have its own unique configurations, customizable via the filters at the top of the page. For accessioning, the most useful fields include:
*	Creator
*	Accessioning Record Title (which deviates from “Title” in that title is the collection name and accessioning record title refers to the accession project)
*	Accession number
*	Stage
*	Location
*	Paperwork
*	Extent information (including linear feet and item number)

At this initial point, confirm the following in Airtable: 
*	That the accession number is entered and correct
*	The Assigned To field includes your name
*	That Paperwork field links to the correct file in the Sharepoint Acquisition folder

#### 3.2.1.2 Create Airtable checklist (optional, but recommended)
*	Click on the Accessioning Checklist tab in the Acquisitions and Accessioning base and navigate to “(yourname)’s View” under the "My personal views" view.
*	Click on the (+) at the bottom right of the screen to open the checklist
*	Type the title of the accession. This is not the collection title, so it can be the "Atlanta Daily World records" if it starts a new collection, but if it's an addition to an existing collection, you will title this space as " Atlanta Daily World additions". [This is a free text field where you can enter whatever title you like. You will link to the Airtable record in the next step.]  
*	Click on Add record. Start typing the name of the accession (as found in the Airtable record) and a suggested list will come up. Click on the correct record to connect the checklist to the appropriate record.
  	- *In cases where there are multiple accessions with similar, if not the same, accession titles, confirm that you have linked to the correct accession record by clicking through the record once you have attached it. Scroll to the bottom of that record, click on the button to “Show (#) fields” and search for the Accession record number to which you can compare to the accession number you are using. If you’ve chosen the wrong accession record, go back to the checklist and hover over the box in the Acquisitions & Accessioning Table Link until the “x” appears.*
   	-*Identifying the "Date of Invoice" can also help you select the correct record as it displays in the selection*
*	As you go through the accessioning process, complete the steps in the Airtable checklist and confirm by clicking the checkboxes.

#### 3.2.1.3 Finalize and update Airtable record
*	When accessioning is completed, use the drop down to update the *Stage* to "Accesioning and/or Cataloging Completed"
*	Confirm the *Accession #* is entered and correct
*	Update the *Linear Feet*, *MSS Items* and *Extent Type* as well as an other *Special Format* fields
*	Enter the current date in the *Accession Date* field
*	Confirm that the correct link is used in the *Paperwork* field
  
### 3.2.2 Accessioning workflow for Processing Archivists
The Head of Processing manages the acquisition workflow, which can overlap steps in the accessioning workflow. Typically, the Head of Processing will have created the stub accession record before handing the accession off to a processing archivist, and the processing archivist is then responsible for updating the record during accessioning.  Processing archivists should refer back to [2.2.3 ArchivesSpace stub accession record](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/02-ACQUISITIONS#223-archivesspace-stub-accession-record<) to verify that all content is entered into the ArchivesSpace accession record. Normally, the archivist will not have to start within the [2.2 Acquisition workflow](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/02-ACQUISITIONS#22-acquisition-workflow-)>), but will only have to follow the accessioning checklist.

Archivists will use the location in Airtable to locate and pull the acquisition materials.  Paperwork should be with the acquisition, but if it isn’t, use the link in Airtable's *Paperwork* field or ArchivesSpace's *External Document* sub-record to print it out and write the accession number on the top of the page.

Update the accession record in ArchivesSpace
*	Update and complete any fields in the accession record that the Head of Processing could not complete during initial receipt, according to [2.2.3 ArchivesSpace stub accession record](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/02-ACQUISITIONS#223-archivesspace-stub-accession-record>). 
	-	Fields in ArchivesSpace marked with a red asterisk are required by ArchivesSpace. 
	-	The Rose Library requires additional information for a record to be considered complete. 
*	Typically, the processing archivist should update:
	-	Extents
	-	Dates
	-	Instances sub-record
		-	If any instances are attached to the Accession Record, delete them after you have pulled the boxes and are ready to begin accessioning, either by deleting the sub-records that are attached to the accession record or through top container management. 
	-	Event records, using the *Browse* drop down menu and select *Accessions* to produce a list of Accessions
		-	Confirm the *Custody Transfer* and *Agreement Signed* event records have been completed by clicking *View* and reviewing the contents (see [2.2.3.10 Event records](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/02-ACQUISITIONS#22310-event-records>)).
		-	Add the *Accession* event record by clicking on *Edit* to open the record and selecting *Accession* from the *Add Event* drop down menu in the top right. Complete the record according the following content:

| Accession Event Fields                                        | Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

*	Save the Event record

## 3.3 Accessioning Digital Objects

In order to ensure consistency across accession records, archivists should use the digital archives controlled vocabulary to describe digital objects (see [10.7.4.1 Digital media controlled vocabulary](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#10741-digital-media-controlled-vocabulary)).

Typically, if we receive laptops or personal computers, we will only retain the internal hard drives following processing. The Digital Archivist will send all other hardware and casings to surplus. You should therefore describe laptops and computers as “hard disks” in accession records (see [10.7.4.1 Digital media controlled vocabulary](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#10741-digital-media-controlled-vocabulary)). If we do have reason to keep the entire computer (either because they feature labels and markings intentionally added by the donor/creator that contribute significant meaning or because the entire computer will be required in order to access and transfer files), describe these as either "computers" or “laptop computers." Consult with the digital archivist if you are unsure of which term to use.
						
Apart from exceptional cases, you should not accession computer peripherals (monitors, keyboards, etc.), networking hardware (routers, for example), and other electronic components not used to store data unless:

* They feature labels and markings intentionally added by the donor/creator that contribute significant meaning to the collection. These should not be labels or markings that simply denote ownership or give instruction on use or function (i.e., “Dorothy’s mouse” or “plug in here”).
* In cases where the associated hardware is particularly old or obscure and it has been deemed likely, following consultation with a digital archivist, that this equipment will be required in order to access and transfer digital files from the associated hardware.

If you have questions about whether a digital object should be accessioned, consult with the digital archivist.

## 3.4 Digital Accessioning Workflows

Like all collection material, born-digital media and files should not be accessioned until paperwork has been completed. The workflow will vary slightly depending on the method of transfer or if the born-digital material is part of a hybrid collection.  

If a hybrid collection includes known born-digital media and/or hardware:

* During the weekly accessioning meeting, the Accessioning Archivist assigns hybrid collection to a member of the accessioning team. 
* The Accessioning Archivist adds information regarding any known born-digital media and/or hardware to the born-digital inventory, which is stored as a [tab in the master shelf list](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/BoxDeletedUsers14/Shared%20Documents/aczebla_emory_edu/MARBL_Master%20SHELF%20LIST/Shelf%20List.xlsx?d=wf0968fe689044379898108b0228a3a62&csf=1&web=1&e=UhojMn&nav=MTVfezAwMDAwMDAwLTAwMDEtMDAwMC0wMzAwLTAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMH0>).
* The accessioning archivist accessions the born-digital media and/or hardware with the rest of the collection, following the steps in the quick guide to processing digital media and using [10.7.4.1 Digital media controlled vocabulary](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#10741-digital-media-controlled-vocabulary) to describe what is included.

If a collection (or addition to a collection) is comprised exclusively of born-digital media and/or hardware:

* The Accessioning Archivist notifies and assigns accessioning responsibilities to the Digital Archivist. Born-digital media and/or hardware is temporarily stored in the accessioning area until retrieved by the digital archivist for accessioning.
* Following the steps in the quick guide to processing digital media and using [10.7.4.1 Digital media controlled vocabulary](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#10741-digital-media-controlled-vocabulary) to describe what is included, the digital archivist accessions the born-digital media and/or hardware.
* Where possible, the digital archivist will also image disks, create digital object records, and ingest preservation copies into the digital repository at the point of accessioning.

Archivists should keep smaller pieces of born-digital media such as floppy disks or flash drives with the collection when moved to the stacks or sent to the LSC. The Digital Archivist will identify a storage location for computer towers and laptops. The accessioning team member will shelve the computer and record the location in the born-digital inventory and the [master shelf list](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/BoxDeletedUsers14/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BF0968FE6-8904-4379-8981-08B0228A3A62%7D&file=Shelf%20List.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true>).

If a hybrid collection includes a file transfer:

* The receiving digital archivist notifies the Accessioning Archivist that a file transfer has been received.
* The receiving digital archivist moves the transferred files to a temporary storage location on the digital archive lab’s local hard drives or the LIBSAFE Go accessioning node. 
* During the weekly accessioning meeting, the Accessioning Archivist assigns hybrid collection to a member of the accessioning team. 
* The accessioning archivist adds information about the file transfer to the born-digital inventory, and notes whether they have ingested the files into the digital repository.
* The accessioning archivist accessions the file transfer with the rest of the collection, using the term “digital files” from [10.7.4.1 Digital media controlled vocabulary](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#10741-digital-media-controlled-vocabulary) to describe what is included.

If a collection (or addition to a collection) is comprised exclusively of a file transfer:

* The receiving digital archivist notifies the Accessioning Archivist that a file transfer has been received.
* During the weekly accessioning meeting, the Accessioning Archivist assigns the collection to a digital archivist. 
* The digital archivist accessions the file transfer, using the term “digital files” from [10.7.4.1 Digital media controlled vocabulary](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#10741-digital-media-controlled-vocabulary) to describe what is included.
* The digital archivist ingests the transferred files into the digital repository.
* The digital archivist adds information about the file transfer to the born-digital inventory, and notes that files have been ingested into the digital repository.

## 3.5 Creating the CL-2 File
The Head of Processing should have created the CL-2 file as part of the acquisition process (see [2.4.2 Creating the CL-2 File](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/blob/master/02-ACQUISITIONS/readme.md#242-creating-the-cl-2-file>)), so it should be placed with the accession materials.

The Archivist accessioning the materials will be responsible for filing the physical documents alphabetically by main entry in the cabinets located on the L9 BizHub room or, in the case of additions, file the paperwork in the established collection file.
