Accessioning is the formal act of taking legal and physical control of an archival or 
manuscript collection. Formally accessioning material helps to establish the 
authenticity of the material through documenting chain of custody. It also gives the 
Rose Library administrative and custodial control over collections and shows that the 
library is acting in good faith when accepting archival material by documenting the 
transfer and its terms. 

The Rose Library aims to make all new acquisitions available to researchers 
immediately following accessioning. Therefore, accessioning new material requires 
sufficient description to make the collection discoverable and usable. Material must 
be described at minimum at the box level, but other descriptive information may be 
limited. Detailed processing is not common at this time, though may be warranted 
(e.g. the collection is quite small, researcher need is high). 

Determine the appropriate [level of processing](/04-LEVELS%20OF%20ARRANGEMENT%20AND%20DESCRIPTION) at the time of accessioning and then move forward with creating the descriptive documents.

## 3.1 Managing Accessioning Workflow

*Note: This workflow was fully implemented for Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19). Collection material received prior to FY19 will be accessioned in ArchivesSpace but may not follow current process.*

When material has been either acknowledged or paid for and is ready to be accessioned 
the Accessioning Archivist will share this information with the 
accessioning team.

*	The Accessioning Archivist maintains an Airtable with all new 
	manuscript acquisitions, and there is a view called "Accessioning To-Be-Assigned" populated with the ones that are ready for discussion at the 
	weekly accessioning meeting.
*	During this meeting, the Accessioning Archivist updates the team on 
	the status of pending collections and gives information on any significant, new 
	collections that have entered the acquisitions process.
*	The accessioning team members add collections to their individual accessioning 
	queues based on current workloads and specific expertise.
*	The electronic version of the paperwork will be linked to from the accession record in ArchivesSpace in the External Documents sub-record.

The system of record for accession information is [ArchivesSpace](<https://emory.lyrasistechnology.org/> "https://emory.lyrasistechnology.org/"). The Accessioning Archivist will create a record in this database upon receipt. One accession record should be created per acquisition, meaning there should be one record for each invoice and/or deed/deed addendum. For collections acquired through a simultaneous purchase and gift, there should be separate accession records for each contract.

**When manuscript material is received, the Accessioning Archivist will:** 

*	Create a basic accession record in ArchivesSpace. 
*	Assign the accession number, as well as complete any field for which they have information, according to the guidelines in the [Emory Libaries Accession Record Field Usage Guidelines](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/AccessionRecord_Field_Usage_Guidelines.docx?d=w0f6d77107ef745069dc384bcc79cd410&csf=1&web=1&e=E8SwOd> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/AccessionRecord_Field_Usage_Guidelines.docx?d=w0f6d77107ef745069dc384bcc79cd410&csf=1&web=1&e=E8SwOd").
*	Document physical receipt of the material in an event record attached to the accession record.
	*	Type is equal to "custody transfer"
	*	The role of the selector linked as an agent is "curator"
	*	Date records the date materials moved into Rose Library possession. Often, this date will align with the creation of the record since new acquisitions should be recorded as soon as they are identified.
*	When deed or deed addendum is present and has been signed by the donor and counter-signed by the Director, document the agreement in an event record attached to the accession record.
	*	Type is equal to "agreement signed"
	*	The role of the donor or seller or signed the deed is linked as an agent with the label of "authorizer"
	*	Date of signing can be found on the paperwork
*	If portions of the same accession are being added to multiple collections:
	*	In the disposition field of the basic information sub-record, describe the disposition of each portion; provide a brief description of the material and the title of the collection to which it is being added
*	Add or update the status of the acquisition in the [Acquisitions & Accessioning Airtable base](<https://airtable.com/shrCBB24THckYDtOa> "https://airtable.com/shrCBB24THckYDtOa")
*	Add the location of the material to the Pending tab in the [Master Shelf List](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/BoxDeletedUsers14/Shared%20Documents/aczebla_emory_edu/MARBL_Master%20SHELF%20LIST/Master%20shelf%20list.xls?d=w5e47b298820e4ed493f614b98b20e8c1&csf=1&web=1&e=ULnYUi> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/BoxDeletedUsers14/Shared%20Documents/aczebla_emory_edu/MARBL_Master%20SHELF%20LIST/Master%20shelf%20list.xls?d=w5e47b298820e4ed493f614b98b20e8c1&csf=1&web=1&e=ULnYUi").

**At the time of accessioning, staff will:**

*	Update and complete any fields in the accession record that the Accessioning Archivist could not complete during receipt, according to the [Emory Libraries Accession Record Field Usage Guidelines](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/AccessionRecord_Field_Usage_Guidelines.docx?d=w0f6d77107ef745069dc384bcc79cd410&csf=1&web=1&e=E8SwOd> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/AccessionRecord_Field_Usage_Guidelines.docx?d=w0f6d77107ef745069dc384bcc79cd410&csf=1&web=1&e=E8SwOd"). 
*	[Create an event record](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/RoseLibrary_EventRecords.docx?d=w254f3b8f58bd4b8d9d20d296507cd83a&csf=1&web=1&e=1zPhic> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/RoseLibrary_EventRecords.docx?d=w254f3b8f58bd4b8d9d20d296507cd83a&csf=1&web=1&e=1zPhic") attached to the accession record to document that the collection has been accessioned
	*	Type is equal to "accession"
	*	The role of the staff member linked as an agent is "accessioner"
	*	Date is the date the event record is created

*	If creating a new collection, assign an identifier to the collection by assigning the next number in sequence in the [Manuscript Register](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Stacks%20Management/Shelf%20Lists/Manuscript%20Register.xlsx?d=w870976b852d84f80b0d6490280b167e5&csf=1&web=1&e=Vg0Tkk) or [EUA Register](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EQyyLS-B7fVHvYOf7t0JLbEBLW_YsrF0AOagwRBVceoxKw?e=MCihpT). See [Description 5.1.3: Identifier](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/blob/master/05-DESCRIPTION/readme.md#513-identifier) for more information about assigning an identifier.
*	Link to an existing resource record for additions to collections or spawn a new resource record for new collections and complete the form according to the [Emory Libraries Resource Record Field Usage Guidelines](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/ResourceRecord_Field_Usage_Guidelines.docx?d=wb0edbbbcf08c4d40a773abe1d5a61fb4&csf=1&web=1&e=zT4xfE> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/ResourceRecord_Field_Usage_Guidelines.docx?d=wb0edbbbcf08c4d40a773abe1d5a61fb4&csf=1&web=1&e=zT4xfE") for stub resource records
*	Print any needed documentation from OneDrive using the external documents link in the accession record and combine with any physical documentation in hand to add to or create the physical CL-2 file. Write the accession number on the deed, if present, or on the invoice if there is no deed.
*	Process the material at whichever level is deemed appropriate and create description according to the policies and procedures outlined in the Rose Library Collection Services Manual.
*	Update the status of the acquisition in the [Acquisitions & Accessioning Airtable base](<https://airtable.com/shrCBB24THckYDtOa> "https://airtable.com/shrCBB24THckYDtOa"). Changing the status to "Complete" will automatically send the curator an email.

The below instructions explain how to make accession records from start to finish. However, please note that most staff will not be creating any records from scratch. Navigate to the part of the instructions applicable to your piece of the workflow.

## 3.2 Creation of the Accession Record

Browse accessions and sort by identifier to see the most recent accession number, so that you may assign the next number in sequence.

![Figure 5: Find accession number](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure5.png "Figure 5: Find accession number")

To create the accession record, click on Create and select Accession.

![Figure 4: Create accession record](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure4.jpg "Figure 4: Create accession record")

Fields in ArchivesSpace marked with a red asterisk are required by ArchivesSpace. The Rose Library requires additional information for a record to be considered complete.

**Populating the Accession Record**


#### Basic Information Subrecord [Required]


| Field                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Title [Required]                             | Assign a title for the accession. For new collections, titles should include both a name segment and the nature of the material being described. The title should be formed according to the rules outlined in the [Description section](/05-DESCRIPTION/#512-title-statement) of the manual. For additions, the title should include the collection title and the word "additions." If the additions are a single item or record type, the title can include that information (e.g., Dianora Niccolini papers audiovisual additions). For additions to miscellany collections, the title will mirror the title of the corresponding paperwork on OneDrive/SharePoint (e.g., Langdon Manor Books_187_FY19, Adam Schachter_2018, etc.).|
| Identifier [Required]                        |  All collection material acquired by the Rose Library is assigned a unique accession number, consisting of the year, the month, and the next accession number in sequence for the month [e.g., 2017-06-34]. There is a separate sequence of accession numbers for MSS collections and for EUA collections. You can determine the next available accession number to assign in ASpace by going to Browse/Accessions and sorting by identifier. For EUA accession records that are created retroactively, assign an accession number that corresponds with the date that the materials were received. (For example, if an accession was received in May 2007, determine the next available accession number in EUA for May 2007.) If an accession number is retroactively assigned, add a note to that effect in the general note field. ![Figure 6: Identifier](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure6_2.png "Figure 6: Identifier")|
| Accession Date [Required]                    |  This field will pre-populate the current date. To change the date, click on the calendar and select the correct date. For recently received materials, this date should always match the day the accession record was originally created and the accession number assigned. For EUA accession records that are created retroactively, choose an accession date that corresponds with the date that the materials were received. ![Figure 7: Accession Date](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure7_2.png "Figure 7: Accession date")|
| Collection Description [Required]            | Include a brief description of the scope and contents of the collection ![Figure 8: Collection description](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure8_2.png "Figure 8: Collection description")|
| Condition Description [Optional; preferred when applicable] | Use this field to describe preservation issues in the collection (mold, water damage, insect presence, or other significant issues) or current organization of the collection. ![Figure 9: Condition description](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure9.png "Figure 9: Condition description")|
| Disposition [Optional; required when applicable]                            | Use this field to describe portions of the same accession with different disposition. Will primarily be used for acquisitions of multiple items from a single dealer that will be added to multiple miscellany collections. List the items and corresponding collections in this field. ![Figure 10: Disposition](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure10.png "Figure 10: Disposition")|
| Inventory [Optional]                               | Use this field to transcribe any existing inventories, for example those provided by the donor or created during packing. Use this field only if the inventory is not in a document that can be linked in the External Documents subrecord. |
| Provenance [Required when applicable]              | Use this field to describe the provenance/custodial history of an accession. Required if there is additional provenance information relevant to a specific accession that is different from the provenance of the rest of the collection. Required when the source of the material is different from the creator of the material. ![Figure 11: Provenance](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure11.png "Figure 11: Provenance") ![Figure 12: More Provenance](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure12.png "Figure 12: More Provenance")|
| Retention Rule [Required when applicable]          | Use this field to record any records management retention rules that apply to the accession. Most likely to be used for University records. |
| General Note [Optional]                           | Use this field to provide any other information relevant to the accession that isn't accounted for elsewhere in the record. If an EUA accession number was retroactively assigned, add a general note to that effect. ![Figure 29: General Note](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure29.jpg "Figure 29: General Note")|
| Acquisition Type [Required]                       | Select the appropriate acquisition type from the drop down menu. Use "Deposit" when collections are transferred without title and a Temporary Custody form is present. Use "Transfer" for transfers within Emory or from one institution to another (e.g., transfer from University of Georgia to the Rose Library)|
| Resource Type [Required]                          | Select the appropriate resource type from the drop down menu. Type should broadly conform to the rules established in DACS Chapter 2.3.18. Resource type may be broader than Title Statement, though they are related.|
| Restrictions Apply? [Required when applicable]    | Check box if either use or access restrictions are present in the accession. |
| Publish | The Rose Library does not and will not publish accession records. This box is pre-checked by ArchivesSpace but repository settings override. The Rose repository is set to not publish.|
| Access Restrictions [Required when applicable]    | If any portion of the accession is restricted from access, check this box.|
| Access Restrictions Note [Required when applicable]   | Describe the restriction here. If this field is in use, it must include a termination date.|
| Use Restrictions [Required when applicable]       | If any portion of the accession is restricted from certain kinds of use, check this box.|
| Use Restrictions Note [Required when applicable]  | Describe the restriction here. |


#### Dates Subrecord [Required]

All accession records require at least one dates subrecord. Add separate subrecords for each type of date being described, for example inclusive and bulk dates. More than one dates subrecord should be rare in accession records.

To add a date subrecord, click the "Add Date" button in the right corner of the subrecord.

![Figure 13: Dates subrecord](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure13.png "Figure 13: Dates Subrecord")

| Field                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Label [Required]                             | "Creation" is selected by default. |
| Expression [Do Not Use]                      | Expression is only used to describe dates when normalized dates are not present or if the expressed dates differ from the normalized dates.  In accession records, the normalized date is preferred. |
| Type [Required]                             | Select from the drop down menu as appropriate. Use bulk dates for the range in which the bulk of the material in the accession was created. Use inclusive dates for the date range in which the entirety of the accession was created. Use a single day for the date of a single item or single year in which all material in the accession was created. |
| Normalization [Required]                    | Enter the beginning and ending dates of the accession. Years are sufficient for most accessions. |
| Certainty [Required if applicable]          | If you are uncertain about the accuracy of the dates, select "circa" from the drop down menu. Otherwise, leave blank.|
| Era [Required]                             | Defaults to "ce." |
| Calendar [Required]                             | Defaults to "Gregorian." |

#### Extents Subrecord [Required]

All accession records require an extents subrecord.

To add an extent record, click the "Add Extent" button in the right corner of the subrecord.

![Figure 15: Add Extents Subrecord](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure15.png "Figure 15: Add Extents Subrecord")

| Field                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Portion [Required]                             | Select "part" or "whole" from the drop down menu as appropriate. Choose "whole" when the accession is the entirety of the acquisition. Choose "part" when the accession includes multiple formats (e.g., paper and born digital) and you're creating multiple extent subrecords. |
| Number [Required]                             | Enter the number of items you're measuring. |
| Type [Required]                             | Select from the drop down menu as appropriate. For accessions, this will most likely be linear feet or item.|
| Container Summary [Required]                             | Use this field to describe the type of containers in which the accession is stored. This is especially helpful if the material is oversized or stored in unusual containers. |
| Physical Details [Optional]                            | Use this field for any additional pertinent details describing the physical state of the collection. |
| Dimensions [Optional]                            | Use this field to note the physical dimensions of the accession. Use of this field will be rare for manuscript accessions. ![Figure 16: Dimensions](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure16.png "Figure 16: Dimensions") |

#### Agent Links Subrecord [Required]

An agent is a person, corporate body, family, or software responsible in some way for the creation or management of a described resource, or the subject of that resource.

Add an agent subrecord for both the source and the creator of the accession, even if they are the same. 

[See Creating an Agent Record in ArchivesSpace.](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/RoseLibrary_AgentRecords.docx?d=w1bcb89e9869e4154aba8432270a243c0&csf=1&web=1&e=PSzxRc> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/RoseLibrary_AgentRecords.docx?d=w1bcb89e9869e4154aba8432270a243c0&csf=1&web=1&e=PSzxRc")

Agent records for curators and archivists responsible for the accession will be added to event records.

#### Related Resources Subrecord [Required]

All accession records must be linked to a resource record. 

When accessioning a new collection, resource records will be spawned from the accession record and automatically linked.

[See Creating a Resource Record in ArchivesSpace](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/RoseLibrary_ResourceRecords.docx?d=w3f0763fa10134a8d842f4ec3aaf92ee9&csf=1&web=1&e=fVaPQ4> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/RoseLibrary_ResourceRecords.docx?d=w3f0763fa10134a8d842f4ec3aaf92ee9&csf=1&web=1&e=fVaPQ4") for spawning instructions.

When accessioning additions to a collection, add a related resources subrecord here. Click "Add Related Resource" in the right corner of the subrecord.

![Figure 17: Add Related Resources Subrecord](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure17.png "Figure 17: Add Related Resources Subrecord")

Type the title or portion of the title into the search box and select the correct collection from the menu.

![Figure 18: Related Resources Subrecord](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure18.png "Figure 18: Related Resources Subrecord")

#### Related Accessions Subrecord [Preferred when applicable]

This subrecord links related accessions. It should be used only when material that is acquired together is accessioned into different collections and not linked to the same resource record. For example, use this record when multiple collections are created out of one acquisition from a single donor (e.g. the Pauline Brown Payne papers and Homer G. Phillips Hospital records) or when a single donor sends additions to multiple collections (e.g. Michael Lomax sends material that includes additions to both his papers and Almena Lomax's papers). Do not link accessions for miscellany collections.

To link a related accession, click the "Add Related Accession" button in the right corner.

![Figure 19: Add Related Accessions Subrecord](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure19.png "Figure 19: Add Related Accessions Subrecord")

From the "Relationship Type" drop down menu, select "Part of" to indicate that material has been acquired as part of a larger whole.

*	From the "This accession" drop down menu, choose "Forms part of" or "Has part"
*	Type the title into the "Accession" search box and select the correct accession record
*	"Relator type" defaults to "Part of"

The easiest way to link accessions is to create the record for the first accession, then link to that record from this subrecord on any subsequent accessions. Choose "forms part of" when completing the subsequent accessions. The links will also appear on the original record with "has part" appearing under "this accession."

For example, below the Pauline Brown Payne papers, accession 2017-02-05 is being linked to the accession record for the Homer G. Phillips School of Nursing records, accession 2016-12-13. 

![Figure 20: Related Accessions Subrecord](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure20.png "Figure 20: Related Accessions Subrecord")

The image below shows the accession record for the Homer G. Phillips School of Nursing records with the accession record for the Pauline Brown Payne papers linked.

![Figure 21: Homer G. Phillips example](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure21.png "Figure 21: Homer G. Phillips example")

You should never have to select "sibling" as a relationship type. The sibling relationship is for linking accession records of accruals to the same collection. Rose Library will be tracking those relationships in the resource record, not the accession record. If you identify a possible exception, discuss with the accessioning team and we will decide as a group if sibling is the correct relationship type. If it is, then complete the subrecord as follows:

*	"This accession" will pre-populate with "Is sibling of"
*	Type the title into the "Accession" search box and select the correct accession record
*	Relator type defaults to "Bound with relationship"

#### Subjects Subrecord [Do not use]

Skip this subrecord. We will not be adding subject terms to accession records.

#### External Documents Subrecord [Required]

Use this field to link to relevant external documentation such as inventories, deeds, appraisal reports, and other acquisition paperwork.

Link to the relevant acquisitions paperwork on OneDrive/SharePoint.

To create an external documents subrecord, click "Add External Document" in the right corner of the subrecord.

#### Rights Statements Subrecord

Used to record rights information specific to an individual accession, as opposed to information that is applicable to an entire collection. This subrecord is not relevant to accession records and will only be used in resource records.

#### Instances Subrecord

This subrecord is not currently in use by Rose Library.

#### Deaccessions Subrecord [Required when applicable]

Add a deaccessions subrecord to record deaccessions contemporaneous to the accession. 
To create a deaccessions subrecord, click "Add Deaccession" in the upper right corner.

#### Collection Management Subrecord

Use this field to record internal information about processing the material. Use of this subrecord for accessions may be rare and will likely not be completed by the accessioning archivist. This field is likely most useful at the point of accessioning when describing plans for processed collections with unprocessed additions.

#### Classifications Subrecord

This subfield is not applicable to Emory University special collections material.

#### User Defined Fields Subrecord [Required]

This subrecord is where you will record the purchase price or appraisal value for accessions.

To create a new user defined fields subrecord, click "Add User Defined Fields" in the right corner of the subrecord.

![Figure 25: Add User Defined Fields Subrecord](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure25.png "Figure 25: Add User Defined Fields Subrecord")

Note that there are many possible fields in this subrecord and only four that Rose Library is interested in: Appraisal value, appraisal date, purchase price, and purchase price currency. The first three are close to each other, and the fourth is farther down the subrecord.

Enter the appraisal value and/or purchase price in the appropriate field. If a purchase was also appraised, always record both values. Only record the appraisal value and date if an official financial appraisal was conducted for the material. Do not record donors' financial valuations of material on Gift-in-Kind Contribution forms if no appraisal report is present.

![Figure 26: Apprisal value and purchase price](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure26.png "Figure 26: Appraisal value and purchase price")

If the collection was financially appraised, select the date of appraisal in the Appraisal date field.

![Figure 27: Appraisal date](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure27.png "Figure 27: Appraisal date")

If the collection is a purchase, also record the currency in which the purchase was made. Most common will be U.S. Dollars and U.K. Pounds.

![Figure 28: Purchase price currency](/02-ACCESSIONING%20AND%20PRECUSTODIAL%20WORK/images/figure28.png "Figure 28: Purchase price currency")

**Finalizing the record**

When you have finished filling out the record, press the Save button. At this point you may spawn a resource record for new collections, as well as add event records to the accession record as needed. Record the accession number on the aperwork filed in the physical CL-2 file.

## 3.3 Accessioning Digital Objects

In order to ensure consistency across accession records, archivists should use the digital archives controlled vocabulary to describe digital objects (see [2.3.4.1 Digital archives controlled vocabulary](#2341-digital-archives-controlled-vocabulary)).

Typically, if we receive laptops or personal computers, we will only retain the internal hard drive following processing. The Digital Archivist will send all other hardware and casings to surplus. You should therefore describe laptops and computers as “hard drives” in accession records (see [2.3.4.1 Digital archives controlled vocabulary](#2341-digital-archives-controlled-vocabulary)). If we do have reason to keep the entire computer (either because they feature labels and markings intentionally added by the donor/creator that contribute significant meaning or because the entire computer will be required in order to access and transfer files), describe these as either “laptop computers” or “microcomputers.” Consult with the digital archivist if you are unsure of which term to use.
						
Apart from exceptional cases, you should not accession computer peripherals (monitors, keyboards, etc.), networking hardware (routers, for example), and other electronic components not used to store data unless:

* They feature labels and markings intentionally added by the donor/creator that contribute significant meaning to the collection. These should not be labels or markings that simply denote ownership or give instruction on use or function (i.e., “Dorothy’s mouse” or “plug in here”).
* In cases where the associated hardware is particularly old or obscure and it has been deemed likely, following consultation with a digital archivist, that this equipment will be required in order to access and transfer digital files from the associated hardware.

If you have questions about whether a digital object should be accessioned, consult with the digital archivist.

## 3.4 Digital Accessioning Workflows

Like all collection material, born-digital media and files should not be accessioned until paperwork has been completed. The workflow will vary slightly depending on the method of transfer or if the born-digital material is part of a hybrid collection.  

If a hybrid collection includes known born-digital media and/or hardware:

* During the weekly accessioning meeting, the Accessioning Archivist assigns hybrid collection to a member of the accessioning team. 
* The accessioning archivist adds information regarding any known born-digital media and/or hardware to the born-digital inventory, which is stored as a tab in the master shelf list.
* The accessioning archivist accessions the born-digital media and/or hardware with the rest of the collection, using the digital archives controlled vocabulary (listed below) to describe what is included.
* Archivists should keep smaller pieces of born-digital media such as floppy disks or flash drives with the collection when moved to the stacks. The Digital Archivist and Accessioning Archivist will identify a storage location for computer towers and laptops.  The accessioning team member will shelve the computer and record the location in the born-digital inventory and the master shelf list.
* If it is a small amount of born-digital material, the accessioning archivist should create the disk images for the collection.  This decision should be made in consultation with the digital archivist.

If a collection (or addition to a collection) is comprised exclusively of born-digital media and/or hardware:

* The Accessioning Archivist notifies and assigns accessioning responsibilities to the Digital Archivist. born-digital media and/or hardware is temporarily stored in the accessioning area until retrieved by the digital archivist for accessioning.
* The digital archivist accessions the born-digital media and/or hardware, using the digital archives controlled vocabulary (see [2.3.4.1 Digital archives controlled vocabulary](#2341-digital-archives-controlled-vocabulary)) to describe what is included.
* Where possible, the digital archivist will image disks and ingest disk images into the digital repository at the point of accessioning.
* The digital archivist adds information about the file transfer to the born-digital inventory, which is stored as a tab in the master shelf list. The archivist should also note whether they have ingested the material into the digital repository.
* The digital archivist creates BD box(es) for accessioned media, including hard drives removed from laptops and computer towers.  If it is not possible to remove a hard drive from its casing, the location of the hardware will be recorded on the master shelf list and the born-digital inventory.

**Note:** If imaging is completed at the time of accessioning, born-digital media and hardware can be transferred immediately to the LSC. 

If a hybrid collection includes a file transfer:

* The receiving digital archivist notifies the Accessioning Archivist that a file transfer has been received.
* The receiving digital archivist moves the transferred files to a temporary storage location on the digital archive lab’s local hard drives. Due to preservation concerns, the digital archivist may ingest transferred files into the digital repository prior to the completion of accessioning.
* During the weekly accessioning meeting, the Accessioning Archivist assigns hybrid collection to a member of the accessioning team. 
* The accessioning archivist adds information about the file transfer to the born-digital inventory, and notes whether they have ingested the files into the digital repository.
* The accessioning archivist accessions the file transfer with the rest of the collection, using the term “Digital files” taken from the digital archives controlled vocabulary (see [2.3.4.1 Digital archives controlled vocabulary](#2341-digital-archives-controlled-vocabulary)) to describe what is included.

If a collection (or addition to a collection) is comprised exclusively of a file transfer:

* The receiving digital archivist notifies the Accessioning Archivist that a file transfer has been received.
* During the weekly accessioning meeting, the Accessioning Archivist assigns the collection to a digital archivist. 
* The digital archivist accessions the file transfer, using the term “Digital files” taken from the digital archives controlled vocabulary (see [2.3.4.1 Digital archives controlled vocabulary](#2341-digital-archives-controlled-vocabulary)) to describe what is included.
* The digital archivist ingests the transferred files into the digital repository.
* The digital archivist adds information about the file transfer to the born-digital inventory, and notes that files have been ingested into the digital repository.

### 3.5 Creating the CL-2 File

The permanent collection files document the history of a collection including, solicitation, acquisition, processing, and later communications with the donor. They will contain transfer paperwork such as deeds of gift or sale and supporting documentation such as invoices, donor correspondence, paper inventories, and other items that help the Rose Library manage and administer the collection. 

When we receive a new collection, the staff member accessioning the material is responsible for creating the collection file and adding collection documentation to the newly created file. Some of this documentation should be transferred to the archivist from the Accessioning Archivist while others can be printed from OneDrive/SharePoint. The [collection file’s label](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Collection%20File%20Folder%20Labels.doc?d=w77a10adb8c2d4fa797bc64adef3a20ef&csf=1&web=1&e=vVH3VP> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Collection%20File%20Folder%20Labels.doc?d=w77a10adb8c2d4fa797bc64adef3a20ef&csf=1&web=1&e=vVH3VP") should include the main entry and the manuscript number. The files are stored alphabetically by main entry. 

If you pull a collection file from the cabinet for longer than a business day, you must fill out an “out” card with the collection title, your name, and the date. When you return the file, remove the out card and add the date you returned it. One might pull a file while accessioning an addition, processing a collection, or to assist a researcher.  Much of the information contained in the collection file is sensitive, and the files are considered confidential. Biographical information, restrictions, rights information, summary collection histories, and inventories may be shared with students and researchers if appropriate.

### 3.5.1 Electronic CL-2 File (Vital Docs Folder)

There are legacy [electronic CL-2 files](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/CL-2%20Permanent%20Manuscript%20Collection%20Files?csf=1&web=1&e=wQoUaX> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/CL-2%20Permanent%20Manuscript%20Collection%20Files?csf=1&web=1&e=wQoUaX") available on OneDrive/SharePoint. These files are no longer maintained since acquisitions paperwork pertaining to new accessions is already maintained on OneDrive and can serve as the electronic record. Once material is accessioned, the connection between the paperwork, the accession record, and the collection will be clear in ArchiveSpace. From FY19 forward, please refer to ArchivesSpace, the physical CL-2 file, and/or the electronic acquisitions paperwork for information concerning the history of collections.
