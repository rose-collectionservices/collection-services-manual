Accessioning is the formal act of taking legal and physical control of an archival or manuscript collection. Formally accessioning material helps to establish the authenticity of the material through documenting the chain of custody. It also gives the Rose Library administrative and custodial control over collections and shows that the library is acting in good faith when accepting archival material by documenting the transfer and its terms.

## 3.1 Moving from Acquisition to Accessioning

*Note: This workflow was fully implemented for Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19). Collection material received prior to FY19 will be recorded in ArchivesSpace but may not follow current process.*

When material is ready to be accessioned, the Head of Processing enters the relevant information about the accession in Airtable.
*	This information can be accessed in the "Accessioning To-Be-Assigned" view.  
*  	The Head of Processing passes relevant information on pending or upcoming acquisitions through minutes taken at the monthly Acquisition Strategies meetings. Information about the status of colllections can be found in the "Potential and/or Not Yet Received" view.
*	Processing team members identify capacity, and the Head of Processing discusses collections that are available for accessioning.  Archivists choose/are assigned collections (which are added their individual accessioning queues in Airtable) based on current workloads and specific expertise when possible. Archivists use their personal views in Airtable to access these lists.
*	- and a link is included in the Airtable record as well as in the accession record in ArchivesSpace in the External Documents sub-record.
*	The Head of Processing will create a stub accessioning record in ArchivesSpace based on the information in the deed (and in the Airtable record) upon receipt of the materials, paperwork, and approval by the curator to move forward.

## 3.2 Accessioning workflow
The accessioning workflow primarily focuses on systems to document the ownership and custody of collection materials through the systems of record and systems that manage them.  The system of record for accessions is [ArchivesSpace](<https://archives.libraries.emory.edu/staff)/>) and [Airtable](<https://airtable.com/appxehhHnKmdPpzld/tblVOysdj8gmTooGt/viwM1W5reGNIwQRe3?blocks=hide>) is used to manage the workflow between acquisition through accessioning. The [Acquisitions folder in Sharepoint](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions?csf=1&web=1&e=5W2pNF>) is the system of record for acquisitions paperwork, and information is linked from there to both ArchivesSpace and Airtable for access. 

The Rose Library aims to make all new acquisitions available to researchers immediately following the accessioning of collection material. Therefore, extensible or minimal processing happens at the point of accessioning to make the collection discoverable and usable. Detailed processing is not necessary at this time, but, at minimum, the material must be described at the box/container level. More granular processing may be done in some cases (e.g., where the collection is quite small or researcher interest is high).  Therefore, while other processing workflows, creation of resource records, and physical processing steps are not part of the accessioning workflow, they are listed in the [3.6 Accessioning Checklist](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/blob/master/03-ACCESSIONING/readme.md#36-accessioning-checklist>) as part of the procedure.

### 3.2.1 Airtable Acquisitions and Accessioning base
The Acquisitions & Accessioning base in Airtable documents the acquisition workflow and includes records of acquisitions based on paperwork from the donor and information from the curatorial team. Airtable also tracks the stages of completion of acquisitions including their location and extent among other administrative content. 

#### 3.2.1.1 Create checklist
*	Click on the *Accessioning Checklist tab* in the Acquisitions and Accessioning base and navigate to “(yourname)’s Gallery View” under the "Accessioning Workflow" view.
*	Click on the (+) at the bottom right of the screen to open the checklist
*	Type the title of the accession. This is not the collection title, so it can be the "Atlanta Daily World records" if it starts a new collection, but if it's an addition to an existing collection, you will title this space as "addition to Atlanta Daily World"
  	-	Note the Date of Invoice on the Acquisitions & Accessioning tab
   	-	Click on the "+Add Record" button next to the "Acquisitions & Accessioning Table Link"
  	-	Start typing the name of the accession (as found in the Airtable record) and a suggested list will come up.
   		- 	Because many of the records have the same name, and the Date of Invoice is the only other field that shows up in the list, you can use that information to identify the correct record.	
    	-	Click on the correct record to connect the checklist to the appropriate record.
	*Confirm that you have linked to the correct accession record by clicking through the record once you have attached it. Scroll to the bottom of that record, click on the button to “Show (#) fields” and search for the Accession record number to which you can compare to the accession number you are using. If you’ve chosen the wrong accession record, go back to the checklist and hover over the box in the Acquisitions & Accessioning Table Link until the “x” appears.*
*	Complete the steps in the Airtable checklist and confirm by clicking the checkboxes.

#### 3.2.1.2 Checklist view

#### 3.2.1.3 Finalize and update Airtable record
*	When accession is completed, use the drop down to update the *Stage* to "Accesioning and/or Cataloging Completed"
*	Confirm the *Accession #* is entered and correct
*	Update the *Linear Feet*, *MSS Items* and *Extent Type* as well as an other *Special Format* fields
*	Update the *Assigned To* field with your name if not already updated
*	Enter the current date in the *Accession Date* field
*	Confirm that the correct link is used in the *Paperwork* field
  
### 3.2.2 ArchivesSpace
The Head of Processing manages the [acquisition workflow](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/edit/master/02-ACQUISITIONS/readme.md#221-receipt-of-new-or-potential-acquisitions>) which can overlap steps in the accessioning workflow including creating the stub accession record in ASpace. In rare circumstances, archivists will need to complete steps in that workflow, but normally, the archivist will follow the [accessioning checklist](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Manuals/Procedure%20Guides/checklists/Accessioning_checklist.docx?d=w1e2057bf9129418e8a56ef133477332e&csf=1&web=1&e=4gfgFP>) to complete the accession record.

Browse accessions and sort by identifier to see the most recent accession number, so that you may assign the next number in sequence.

<kbd><p align="center"><img src="/03-ACCESSIONING/Images/figure5.png" alt="Figure 5: Find accession number" width="75%"/></p></kbd>

To create the accession record, click on Create and select Accession.

<kbd><p align="center"><img src="/03-ACCESSIONING/Images/figure4.jpg" alt="Figure 4: Create accession record" width="75%"/></p></kbd>

Update and complete any fields in the accession record that the Head of Processing could not complete during initial receipt, according to the [Emory Libaries Accession Record Field Usage Guidelines](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace Workflow and Instruction Docs/AccessionRecord_Field_Usage_Guidelines.docx?d=w0f6d77107ef745069dc384bcc79cd410&csf=1&web=1&e=E8SwOd>). Fields in ArchivesSpace marked with a red asterisk are required by ArchivesSpace. The Rose Library requires additional information for a record to be considered complete.

#### 3.2.2.2 Dates sub-record
*	All accession records require at least one dates subrecord. 
 	-	Add separate subrecords for each type of date being described, for example inclusive and bulk dates. 
   	-	More than one dates subrecord should be rare in accession records.
*	To add a date subrecord, click the "Add Date" button in the right corner of the subrecord.
  	<kbd><p align="center"><img src="/03-ACCESSIONING/Images/figure13.png" alt="Figure 13: Add Accessioning Date" width="75%"/></p></kbd>
* 	See [6.1.7 Dates](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/06-DESCRIPTION#617-dates>)


#### 3.2.2.3 Extents sub-record
*	All accession records require an extents subrecord.
*	Since the accession record doesn't have the option to automate the creation of an extent field, this must be filled in by the archivist.

The table contains information where the content in the accession record deviates from [6.1.8 Extent](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/06-DESCRIPTION#618-extent>)


| Field                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
|**Portion [Required]**|<ul><li>Select from the drop-down menu as appropriate</li><p>-Choose "whole" when the accession is the entirety of the collection<p>-Choose "part" when the accession is an accrual to or portion of the collection</ul>|
|**Type [Required]**|<ul><li>Related to the Number field (which is also required)</li><li>Field will fill in as you type</li><li>Usually either *Linear Feet* or *Item(s)* </li></ul>|

|**Physical Details [Optional]**|Use this field for any additional, pertinent details describing the physical state of the collection.|
|**Dimensions [Optional]**|This field will rarely be used for manuscript accessionins, but it can be used to note and additional, physical dimensions of the accession|

#### 3.2.2.4 Agent links sub-record 
An agent is a person, corporate body, family, or software responsible in some way for the creation or management of a described resource, or the subject of that resource. 

Accession records require two Agent links:
*	Role [Required]
	-	Select **Source** from the drop down menu to identify the donor/supplier of the acquisition
 	-	Select **Creator** from the drop down menu to identify the content creator of the acquisition materials
*	Agent [Required]
  	-	Using the drop down menu, select *Browse* to search for the name of the Role selected
   	-	If the *Agent Name* has not been already been created in our system, create the name using the workflow found in the [RoseLibrary_AgentRecords](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B1BCB89E9-869E-4154-ABA8-432270A243C0%7D&file=RoseLibrary_AgentRecords.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true>)
*	Relator [Optional]
  	-	Can be used if archivist finds the content to be helpful or appropriateto indicate a more specific relationship of the creator/source to the material being described.
   	-	Rarely used	

#### 3.2.2.5 Related Resources sub-record 
[Required]
*	All accession records must be linked to a resource record.
	-	When the accession is establishing a new collection, this field autopopulate upon the spawning of a Resource Record from the Accession Record and establish a link between the two.
 	-	When the accession is an addition to a collection, the field will autopopulate with titles as you type in the Resource record title or you can click the drop down menu to *Browse* collection titles.

#### 3.2.2.6 Related Accessions sub-record
[Preferred when applicable]
This subrecord links related accessions. It should be used only when material that is acquired together is accessioned into different collections and not linked to the same resource record. 
*	Use this record when:
	-	Multiple collections are created out of one acquisition from a single donor (e.g., the Pauline Brown Payne papers and Homer G. Phillips Hospital records)
	-	A single donor sends additions to multiple collections under one deed (e.g., a Michael Lomax accession that includes additions to both his papers and Almena Lomax's papers).
*	Do not link accessions for miscellany collections.
*	The easiest way to link accessions is to create the record for the first accession, then generate the Related Accession link between the subsequent accessions as they are created.
  	-	The original accession will use the "has part" designation to the subsequent accessions
   	-	Choose "forms part of" when completing the subsequent accessions.
      
To create a related accession
*	Click the "Add Related Accession" button in the right corner.
*	From the "Relationship Type" drop down menu, select "Part of" to indicate that material has been acquired as part of a larger whole.
	-	**The "Sibling Relationship" will not be used in Rose Library records**
 	-	The sibling relationship is for linking accession records of accruals to the same collection. Rose Library will be tracking those relationships in the resource record, not the accession record.
*	From the "This accession" field, use the drop down menu to select:
	-	"Has part" to identify the original accession
 	-	"Forms part of" to signify the subsequent accessions
*	Type the title into the "Accession" search box and select the correct accession record
*	"Relator type" autopulates as "Part of"

Below is an example of the Pauline Brown Payne papers (accession number 2017-02-05) being linked to the accession record for the Homer G. Phillips School of Nursing records (accession number 2016-12-13).

#### 3.2.2.7 Instances sub-record
If any instances exist from the stub record created as part of the acquisition workflow, remove these instances when you complete the minimal processing at theh point of accessioning.

#### 3.2.2.8 Event records
Confirm the Custody Transfer and Agreement Signed event records have been completed
*	Use *Browse* drop down menu and select *Accessions* to search for the accession.
*	Identify the accession and use the *View* option to access the record
*	Scroll to the Events Subrecord to view the event types
*	If not completed, follow workflow in Acquisitions section

At the point of accessioning, the archivist will create an Accession event record to document the completion of the workflow.
*	Click on the *Edit* button on the top left to open the record
*	Click on the *Add Event* drop down menu on the top right and select *Accession*; click *Add Event*
	-	Basic information heading
 		-	Type is equal to "accession"
		-	Outcome is “Fulfilled”
	-	Event Date/time heading
		-	Choose "UTC Timestamp" as the specifier in the drop down menu
		-	Add the current date in the format noted into the UTC Timestamp field (YYYY-MM-DD)
  		-	Hours, minutes, and seconds not required		
	-	Agent link heading
		-	Role: Use the drop down menu to select "archivist"
		-	Agent: archivist’s name

## 3.3 Accessioning Digital Objects

In order to ensure consistency across accession records, archivists should use the digital archives controlled vocabulary to describe digital objects (see [10.7.4.1 Digital media controlled vocabulary](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#10741-digital-media-controlled-vocabulary)).

Typically, if we receive laptops or personal computers, we will only retain the internal hard drives following processing. The Digital Archivist will send all other hardware and casings to surplus. You should therefore describe laptops and computers as “hard disks” in accession records (see [10.7.4.1 Digital media controlled vocabulary](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#10741-digital-media-controlled-vocabulary)). If we do have reason to keep the entire computer (either because they feature labels and markings intentionally added by the donor/creator that contribute significant meaning or because the entire computer will be required in order to access and transfer files), describe these as either "computers" or “laptop computers." Consult with the digital archivist if you are unsure of which term to use.
						
Apart from exceptional cases, you should not accession computer peripherals (monitors, keyboards, etc.), networking hardware (routers, for example), and other electronic components not used to store data unless:

* They feature labels and markings intentionally added by the donor/creator that contribute significant meaning to the collection. These should not be labels or markings that simply denote ownership or give instruction on use or function (i.e., “Dorothy’s mouse” or “plug in here”).
* In cases where the associated hardware is particularly old or obscure and it has been deemed likely, following consultation with a digital archivist, that this equipment will be required in order to access and transfer digital files from the associated hardware.

If you have questions about whether a digital object should be accessioned, consult with the digital archivist.

## 3.4 Digital Accessioning Workflows

Like all collection material, born-digital media and files should not be accessioned until paperwork has been completed. The workflow will vary slightly depending on the method of transfer or if the born-digital material is part of a hybrid collection.  

If a hybrid collection includes known born-digital media and/or hardware:

* During the weekly accessioning meeting, the Accessioning Archivist assigns hybrid collection to a member of the accessioning team. 
* The Accessioning Archivist adds information regarding any known born-digital media and/or hardware to the born-digital inventory, which is stored as a [tab in the master shelf list](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/BoxDeletedUsers14/Shared%20Documents/aczebla_emory_edu/MARBL_Master%20SHELF%20LIST/Shelf%20List.xlsx?d=wf0968fe689044379898108b0228a3a62&csf=1&web=1&e=UhojMn&nav=MTVfezAwMDAwMDAwLTAwMDEtMDAwMC0wMzAwLTAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMH0>).
* The accessioning archivist accessions the born-digital media and/or hardware with the rest of the collection, following the steps in the quick guide to processing digital media and using [10.7.4.1 Digital media controlled vocabulary](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#10741-digital-media-controlled-vocabulary) to describe what is included.

If a collection (or addition to a collection) is comprised exclusively of born-digital media and/or hardware:

* The Accessioning Archivist notifies and assigns accessioning responsibilities to the Digital Archivist. Born-digital media and/or hardware is temporarily stored in the accessioning area until retrieved by the digital archivist for accessioning.
* Following the steps in the quick guide to processing digital media and using [10.7.4.1 Digital media controlled vocabulary](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#10741-digital-media-controlled-vocabulary) to describe what is included, the digital archivist accessions the born-digital media and/or hardware.
* Where possible, the digital archivist will also image disks, create digital object records, and ingest preservation copies into the digital repository at the point of accessioning.

Archivists should keep smaller pieces of born-digital media such as floppy disks or flash drives with the collection when moved to the stacks or sent to the LSC. The Digital Archivist will identify a storage location for computer towers and laptops. The accessioning team member will shelve the computer and record the location in the born-digital inventory and the [master shelf list](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/BoxDeletedUsers14/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BF0968FE6-8904-4379-8981-08B0228A3A62%7D&file=Shelf%20List.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true>).

If a hybrid collection includes a file transfer:

* The receiving digital archivist notifies the Accessioning Archivist that a file transfer has been received.
* The receiving digital archivist moves the transferred files to a temporary storage location on the digital archive lab’s local hard drives or the LIBSAFE Go accessioning node. 
* During the weekly accessioning meeting, the Accessioning Archivist assigns hybrid collection to a member of the accessioning team. 
* The accessioning archivist adds information about the file transfer to the born-digital inventory, and notes whether they have ingested the files into the digital repository.
* The accessioning archivist accessions the file transfer with the rest of the collection, using the term “digital files” from [10.7.4.1 Digital media controlled vocabulary](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#10741-digital-media-controlled-vocabulary) to describe what is included.

If a collection (or addition to a collection) is comprised exclusively of a file transfer:

* The receiving digital archivist notifies the Accessioning Archivist that a file transfer has been received.
* During the weekly accessioning meeting, the Accessioning Archivist assigns the collection to a digital archivist. 
* The digital archivist accessions the file transfer, using the term “digital files” from [10.7.4.1 Digital media controlled vocabulary](/10-PHYSICAL%20PROCESSING#10741-digital-media-controlled-vocabulary) to describe what is included.
* The digital archivist ingests the transferred files into the digital repository.
* The digital archivist adds information about the file transfer to the born-digital inventory, and notes that files have been ingested into the digital repository.

### 3.5 Creating the CL-2 File

The permanent collection files document the history of a collection including solicitation, acquisition, processing, and communications with the donor. They will contain transfer paperwork such as deeds of gift or sale and supporting documentation such as invoices, donor correspondence, paper inventories, and other items that help the Rose Library manage and administer the collection. 

At the point of accessioning, the Head of Processing will 
*	Link the deeds and other acquisitions paperwork (found in the [Sharepoint Acquisitions folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions?csf=1&web=1&e=1TZPwS>)) to:
	-	The ArchivesSpace Accession Record under *External Documents*
	-	The Airtable record in the Acquisitions & Accessions base in the *Paperwork* field.
*  	Either print out the electronic copy or include the original paperwork with the collection material
*  	Tell the Archivist where the materials and paperwork are located.

The Archivist who will accession the materials will create the physical CL-2 file
*	Write the accession number on the paperwork
*	Print the [collection file’s label](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Collection%20File%20Folder%20Labels.doc?d=w77a10adb8c2d4fa797bc64adef3a20ef&csf=1&web=1&e=vVH3VP>)
*	File the physical documents alphabetically by main entry in the cabinets located on the L9 BizHub room.
*	If the accession is an addition, the archivist will file the paperwork in the established collection file.

If you pull a collection file from the cabinet for longer than a business day, you must fill out an “out” card with the collection title, your name, and the date. When you return the file, remove the out card and add the date you returned it. One might pull a file while accessioning an addition, processing a collection, or to assist a researcher.  Much of the information contained in the collection file is sensitive, and the files are considered confidential. Biographical information, restrictions, rights information, summary collection histories, and inventories may be shared with students and researchers if appropriate.

### 3.5.1 Electronic CL-2 File (Vital Docs Folder)

There are legacy [electronic CL-2 files](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/CL-2%20Permanent%20Manuscript%20Collection%20Files?csf=1&web=1&e=wQoUaX>) available on OneDrive/SharePoint. These files are no longer maintained since acquisitions paperwork pertaining to new accessions is already maintained on OneDrive and available through ArchivesSpace and Airtable and can serve as the electronic record. Once material is accessioned, the connection between the paperwork, the accession record, and the collection will be clear in ArchiveSpace. From FY19 forward, please refer to ArchivesSpace, the physical CL-2 file, and/or the electronic acquisitions paperwork for information concerning the history of collections.
