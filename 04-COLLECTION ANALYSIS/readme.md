The first step in processing is conducting a thorough collection analysis.  The 
analysis is the foundation for all decisions about levels of arrangement and 
description and enables the imposition of both physical and intellectual control onto 
a collection.  

*	Intellectual control:  The creation of tools such as catalogs, finding aids, or 
	other guides that enable users to locate materials relevant to their interests.
*	Physical control:  The function of tracking the storage of records to ensure that 
	they can be located.<a href="#anchor1"><sup>1</sup></a>
	
## 3.1 Determine Provenance and Original Order

*	Provenance: 1. The origin or source of something. - 2. Information regarding the 
	origins, custody, and ownership of an item or collection.
*	Original order:  The organization and sequence of records established by the 
	creator (and possibly users) of the records.

*Provenance* is a fundamental principle in archival practice that dictates that the 
records or papers created by one entity not be intermingled with the papers or records created by another entity.  Retaining collections as distinct entities according to provenance preserves important contextual information necessary for understanding the material.  The creation, use, and storage of a collection may all affect the meaning and interpretation of the records.  Provenance often refers to the creator of the material, but can also refer to agents who collected or otherwise accumulated, received, or housed the material.  

Curatorial staff should provide the archivist with as much provenance information as 
they can.  For especially large and important collections, curators will write a 
collection prospectus ("one-pager") prior to acquisition describing the history and 
research value of the material. This document, when available, will be uploaded with 
other acquisition paperwork to Box. The Rose Library may receive collections directly 
from the creator or a close family member or from rare book and manuscript dealers. It is rare for dealers to include provenance information with material they sell. However, when it is available to them, they will include it in the dealer description 
that also describes the contents of the material.	

Identifying and preserving original order maintains the relationships and evidential 
significance of material within the context of the collection.  Preserving original 
order also allows archivists to work more efficiently while providing meaningful 
access to patrons.  Original order does not necessarily equate to the order in which 
the material is received.  In the case of personal papers, original order may be 
difficult to recognize or have been disrupted beyond intelligibility throughout its 
custodial history.  In cases where the context of creation and use cannot be easily 
preserved, archivists will need to determine whether the collection and its users are 
best served by maintaining the existing disorder or by imposing an arrangement scheme 
on the collection.  Significant time and effort should not be spent recreating 
original order when it's not apparent.  Carefully document your decision-making 
process, as it will form the basis of the processing note (see [5.1.17 Processing note](/05-DESCRIPTION#5117-processing-note) for more information).  

## 3.2 Condition Assessment/Physical Inventory

Assess the current physical condition of the collection (this will actually be done 
concurrently with determining original order).  Begin by briefly examining the 
contents of each box. Make sure there is enough space to open boxes and look through 
folders, paying particular attention to the activities the papers document, topics 
that they cover, and how they are currently organized.  Note the current arrangement; 
are the papers arranged alphabetically, chronologically, or topically?  This existing 
arrangement--the original order of the collection--will guide your final arrangement decisions. At this point, the existing order (or apparent disorder) should not be altered.

Keep track of the materials found in the boxes and make a rough outline of the 
contents of each box paying particular attention to and making note of the types of 
materials found there (e.g. correspondence, minutes, financial records), general dates of the materials in each box, formats of the materials, and any preservation issues like odd smells, mold, signs of insect or rodent infestation, water damage, or 
extremely fragile material.  Refer to the [Preservation During Processing](/9-PRESERVATION/readme.md/#preservation-during-processing) 
section for additional information.

## 3.3 Determine Level of Arrangement and Description

Start by analyzing the records (their content and context) at a high level. What does 
the collection as a whole tell us? What are the major pieces of the collection and 
how do they relate to each other? Why does that matter? How can we best expose all of 
this to researchers? Archivists are trained to understand the ways that records are 
created and to assess their potential value as evidence, information, and/or as 
symbols. This requires having a thorough understanding of the collection as a whole 
before assigning levels of arrangement and description.  Archival processing should 
be a top down endeavor-it should start with analyzing the overall context of a 
collection to understand what it documents and how it does so and then aggregating 
groupings of content within the collection.  Processing work should always proceed 
from the general to the specific. 

Once you have done a broad analysis of the collection determine the level(s) of 
arrangement and description necessary to provide meaningful access to the records. 
You will want to consult with the Head of Collection Services and the appropriate 
curator to make sure you know what the repository's goals are for the collection, so 
that you can determine what level of arrangement and description will most 
effectively and efficiently meet those goals. In general, you are looking for the 
"golden minimum," the least granular level of arrangement and description that will 
meet the stated access and use goals for the collection. [Greene and Meissner](<www.archivists.org/prof-education/pre-readings/IMPLP/AA68.2.MeissnerGreene.pdf> "www.archivists.org/prof-education/pre-readings/IMPLP/AA68.2.MeissnerGreene.pdf")

### 3.3.1 Identifying intellectual units within collections:

Archivists will always describe records, at minimum, at the collection level, but 
most large or more complex collections will have additional groupings of material. These groupings (which could be series and/or subseries) may correlate to the 
functional areas of a person's life or an organization's business activity; be format 
based; or document particular subjects, interests, or relationships.  In 
institutional or administrative records, these units will correspond to 
administrative offices and/or business purposes.  In personal papers, units are more 
likely to correspond to different elements of an individual's personal and 
professional activity.  Intellectual units may also be based on documentary format, 
such as photographs or born digital material.  When components are organized by 
format it is generally for preservation purposes, to enhance access to material whose 
format is inherently valuable in itself, or because the creator maintained them 
separately.  In large collections, components may be sub-categorized to reflect 
further intellectual divisions of material.  

When physically sorting/arranging material, move carefully through the collection 
from broadest to most granular.  Beginning with the collection as it was received (or 
arranged during accessioning), physically aggregate materials into broad categories 
based on the function of the records, the sphere of activity that they document or, 
potentially, their format.  This will be informed by the original order or original 
use of the records and will likely become your series.  

During the first sort, do not remove materials from their original enclosures or 
discard anything; the focus here is on identifying and understanding groups of files, 
not on individual documents or even individual files within a grouping.  If 
additional sorting is required for a researcher to make sense of a collection, it 
will happen on a second or third pass through the records as you refine your 
arrangement and description based on a better understanding of the material and its 
creation and use.  These subsequent levels of sorting and arranging will vary from 
collection to collection.  Processing often entails regular refinement of categories 
and groupings as your understanding of a collection increases. 

Because archival description is hierarchical, each level of description inherits the 
characteristics of its parent component.  Therefore, if something is true of a 
series, it must be true of all things in the series, whether a subseries or 
individual files. For example, a series limited to only creative works by a donor may 
contain different types of writings or artwork, but it should not contain creative 
works by other individuals.  Similarly, if a collection contains material created by 
a mother and daughter, it would be inappropriate to title the collection the Jane 
Smith papers rather than the Jane and Julie Smith papers or the Jane Smith family 
papers.
