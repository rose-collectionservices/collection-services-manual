## 1.1 What it means to process:


A collection is "processed" when sufficient physical and intellectual control is imposed upon the collection by an archivist to facilitate its use.  A processed collection has been at least minimally described through basic inventories and narrative description that includes administrative information as well as contextual information about the collection.   

Archivists process collections by applying their knowledge of professional best practices in collections management, arrangement, description, and preservation to the documents in the collection to make it accessible to researchers.  Processing also includes research about the collection creator and other topics that shed light on the context in which the collection was created and used before acquisition.  Archivists provide this information to patrons in the form descriptive documents such as finding aids and bibliographic catalog records. 

## 1.2 What we do and do not do when we process:


### We do:

*	Try to provide enough description of a collection's structure and content 
	that a user can navigate the collection and locate research material.
*	Reflect the meaningful relationships that we identify between records, and 
	between records and their creators. 
*	Provide scope and content notes that indicate what a user might find in a 
	collection, series, or file-and what might be missing or unascertainable. 
*	Focus on groupings and aggregations of materials and the relationships between 
	them.
*	Focus on context rather than content.
*	Seek to be as transparent as possible about the actions that we take on 
	records and the changes that we make to collections.
*	Use professional training and judgment to determine appropriate levels of 
	arrangement and description for collections. 

### We do not:

*	Read every file or document in the collection. 
*	Interpret the meaning or possible use of a collection or document.
*	Arrange items within files or folders.
*	Promise to identify every occurrence of personal information.
