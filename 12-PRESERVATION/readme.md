## 12.2 Moldy Materials

When you encounter moldy materials while processing or accessioning: 
* Segregate the damaged items from the rest of the collection. 
* Consult with the Rose Library Preservation Liaison to determine how to treat the items. Very minor mold presence may be treated with a microfiber cloth. More signifcant damage will need to be treated by professional conservators. Depending on the volume of damaged material, we may need to outsource the treatment. Small amounts of material can more easily be handled by the Emory Libraries conservation lab. On average, we should expect treatment to take one month per linear foot if the material is being treated by Emory conservators.
* If moldy items/boxes need to be sent to the conservation lab for treatment, add that information to the [conservation list](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Preservation/Rose%20Library%20Conservation%20(non-exhibit)/MARBL_Conservation_List.xlsx?d=w481f92f98d334d7a9224cf3d97af184c&csf=1&web=1&e=3J99CG).
* Moldy items awaiting treatment for mold should be stored in a separate box with an ["awaiting treatment for mold" label](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/Eehvcn_molpJsIzuBOZTRY0BgOTSxpOaPlu_JiyR6Op0SA?e=AyfQP4), printed on **bright pink paper**. Items may also be placed in plastic bags. Items awaiting treatment for mold **cannot be sent to the LSC.**

When contaminated materials return from being treated:
* The Preservation Liaison will follow the instructions in [9.3.1](#931-manuscript-and-archival-material) for items that have been returned from conservation.
* The archivist will complete processing but keep the moldy material physically segregated. Materials that have been treated by a vendor may need additional time to off-gas. Create a new box for the previously moldy items. Dispose of boxes that had previously housed moldy materials.
* Add the archival objects to ArchivesSpace if necessary. In manage top containers, add the box's barcode, container profile, and location.
* Label the outside of the box(es) with a [mold notice label](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EWuF3Lzs0JxClM8yNxB0KjABep0uDkgZWXzg1RZFiNGIQQ?e=wdOjNb) according to the instructions in  [6.6.2 Boxing collections](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE#662-boxing-collections).
* It is highly preferred to send items that have been treated for mold to the LSC following treatment. Boxes that were previously treated for mold but must remain onsite should be shelved with the rest of the location.
   

## 12.3 Sending Collection Material to the Conservation Lab 
 
The Head of Collection Services, Rose Library Preservation Liaison, and Rare Book Cataloger meet quarterly to discuss preservation priorities and plan treatments for the upcoming quarter. Moldy items, photographs stuck together, torn pages, and special rehousing of large or oddly shaped materials are among the most common conservation problems in manuscript collections. 

### 12.3.1 Manuscript and EUA material

The process by which manuscript and archives items enter and move through the queue is as follows: 

Identification of preservation issue and initial assessment:
1. If preservation problems are found, notify the Rose Library preservation liaison for manuscripts and archives who will consult with the Conservation Unit. The Rose Library preservation liaison is the only staff person who may transfer manuscript and archives material to the conservation lab. Conservators will not accept material for treatment from any other staff person. 
2. Rose Library liaison will add the item to the [conservation list](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Preservation/Rose%20Library%20Conservation%20(non-exhibit)/MARBL_Conservation_List.xlsx?d=w481f92f98d334d7a9224cf3d97af184c&csf=1&web=1&e=3J99CG).   
3. Rose Library liaison assesses the problem/material and assigns it a category based on the following criteria: extent of damage, value, use, relationship to other projects, and other institutional needs (such as loans).

Transferring items to the conservation lab:
1. Rose Library liaison meets monthly with the conservation staff. In advance of that meeting, the Rose Library liaison checks in with the conservation staff to see if they are ready to accept additional materials for treatment. During the monthly meeting, they discuss the current list of materials on the spreadsheet awaiting treatment, in addition to the materials already in the conservation lab undergoing treatment, in order to ensure everything is on schedule.  
2. Once the Rose Library liaison is ready to send an item down to the conservation lab:
	* Create an Aeon request for the item. For processed collections, request the item through ArchivesSpace. For unprocessed collections, create a transaction manually. Manual transactions must include: 
		* Title [Collection title statement];
		* Item description [Folder title or brief description of material if unprocessed];
		* Author [Creator/Main entry];
   		* Shelf location [if there is an existing shelf location];
   	 	* Call number [MSS or Series number];
		* Volume/Box;
		* Folder.
   	* In Aeon, document that the item is being sent to conservation:	
		* Add a note to the notes field on the request, which describes the preservation problem and states that the item is being sent down to the conservation lab. 
		* Assign that request to the activity "Rose - Preservation - MSS, EUA, and books."
		* Route the request to "In Conservation - Normal Workflow."
   	* In Aeon, using the "Reprint Callslip" button, print one copy of the call slip.  
		* One half of the call slip stays with the item as it travels to the conservation lab.
		* One half of the call slip is put in place of the box in the shelving location, or in the case of single items is placed inside the box from which the item was removed.
   	* Update the conservation list to reflect that the item has been sent to conservation.
   	* If appropriate, the Rose Library liaison will add a Restrictions on Access note to the archival object or resource record in ArchivesSpace.
   	* If an entire box is being sent to conservation, you can also change the location of the box in ArchivesSpace to [PRESOFFICE] if that makes sense.
3. Rose Library liaison will deliver the item with call slip to the conservation staff during the monthly meeting. 
4. Rose Library liaison and conservation staff will discuss the level and types of treatment.  A due date for return of the item to the Rose Library should also be determined if appropriate. 

When the item is returned from the conservation lab, the Rose Library liaison will:
* In Aeon:
 	* Remove the request from the preservation activity (done on the request itself).
	* Route the request to "Request finished."
* Update the conservation list to reflect that treatment is complete and item has been returned.
* If Preservation staff completed a [conservation treatment report](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/ESzIgvOBA5JJl7791CCMt7wBlqa2ophHphE0jhK0hd5kwQ?e=GbLglz), print two copies. File one in the CL-2 file and place one in the box with the item, if appropriate.
* In ArchivesSpace, remove any restrictions from the item/s, if necessary.
* In ArchivesSpace, create an event attached to the resource record to document the conservation treatment.
  	*  Event type = Conservation treatment
   	*  UTC timestamp = [date items returned from conservation]
  	*  Agent = [Preservation Liaison who received material from Preservation staff]
   	*  Agent role = Archivist
  	*  Record link = [should already link to the resource record]
   	*  External documents (required if applicable)
   	  	* Title = [insert title of conservation treatment report]
   	  	* Location = [insert link to conservation treatment report]
   	* If additional info needs to be recorded in the event record (i.e. the specific items treated) or there is no treatment report to link to in external documents, add that info in the Outcome Note.
* Refile the item in the collection or reshelve the box. If part of an ongoing processing project, the liaison will return the material to the appropriate archivist.   	 


### 12.3.2 Books

The Rose Library preservation liaison is currently responsible for managing and tracking the workflow of books to the conservation lan. (The Rare Book Cataloger would normally be responsible for this.) 

Collection Services staff may identify items that need repair at the point of cataloging, during stacks walk-throughs, in the reading room, or before items go on or return from exhibition. Very infrequently items are too fragile to catalog and move directly to Preservation. Any item that needs preservation should be brought to the attention of the Rare Book Cataloger.  

The process by which books enter and move through the queue is as follows: 

1. The Rare Book Cataloger sends all books with boards or covers that are flaking, fraying, or showing additional damage to preservation for acid free enclosures. They also send all rare books with jackets to preservation for mylar jacket covers.
2. Preservation issues identified at point of cataloging: catalogers will flag items for Preservation on the tab where they notate the call number and send them to Marking.
3. After the item is properly marked, the Marking student moves those items to the designated “PreservationPrep” bays.
4. Items are added to the [conservation list](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Preservation/Rose%20Library%20Conservation%20(non-exhibit)/MARBL_Conservation_List.xlsx?d=w481f92f98d334d7a9224cf3d97af184c&csf=1&web=1&e=3J99CG).
5. Once the Rose Library liaison/Rare Book Cataloger is ready to send an item down to the conservation lab:
	* Create an Aeon request for the item.
   	* In Aeon, document that the item is being sent to conservation:	
		* Add a note to the notes field on the request, which describes the preservation problem and states that the item is being sent down to the conservation lab. 
		* Assign that request to the activity "Rose - Preservation - MSS, EUA, and books."
		* Route the request to "In Conservation - Normal Workflow."
   	* In Aeon, using the "Reprint Callslip" button, print one copy of the call slip.  
		* One half of the call slip stays with the item as it travels to the conservation lab.
		* One half of the call slip is put in place of the book in the shelving location.
   	* Update the conservation list to reflect that the item has been sent to conservation.
6. When the item is returned, the Rose Library liaison/Rare Book Cataloger will:
	* In Aeon:
 		* Remove the request from the preservation activity (done on the request itself).
		* Route the request to "Request finished."	
	* Update the conservation list to reflect that treatment is complete and has been returned.
 	* Reshelve the book.  
 	 

**Special Procedures:**

* Bring any vault items that need treatment to the attention of the Rare Book Cataloger immediately. The Rare Book Cataloger will send these items directly to Preservation, and they have priority for treatment. 
* Give any items showing mold, or suspected of being moldy to the Rare Book Cataloger for immediate delivery to Preservation, whether or not they have been cataloged. If the cataloger is out of the office, give the items to the Rose Library preservation liaison. 

### 12.3.3 Audiovisual Material

The audiovisual liaison is responsible for identifying audiovisual mateiral in manuscript collections, reviewing the material, and sending items to the Conservation Lab for preservation. Due to the instability of magnetic tape as a format, all non-commercial audiovisual materials are digitally reformatted to preserve the content of the tape, and researchers can only access that content via digital surrogate in our reading room. The process by which manuscript and archives items enter and move through the queue is as follows:

1. During processing, audiovisual materials should be physically grouped together, and the [Audiovisual Inventory Update Form](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Audiovisual%20Materials/Audiovisual%20documentation_administrative/Link%20to%20the%20Audiovisual%20Inventory%20Update.docx?d=w1cf2158bab644c5aa833b6c668e29299&csf=1&web=1&e=jkox6V) should be filled out for the collection. This information will be marked as priority for digitization. **Note:** Commercial recordings are not necessarily removed at this time since access may be granted on the rarity of the items.
2. Rose Library liaison will add the item to the [Conservation List](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Audiovisual%20Materials/Orders/AV%20Conservation%20List?csf=1&web=1&e=4qcHyL) on Box 
3. Rose Library liaison assesses priority of the material as well as the risk assessment for digitization.
4. If [items are requested by patrons](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Audiovisual%20Materials/Audiovisual%20documentation_administrative/Procedures_Orders_Patron_AV.docx?d=w943d180d84104230815e029643cfbf15&csf=1&web=1&e=tTbXDC), Research Services staff will track the transaction in AEON 
5. Rose Library liaison will create a collection-level record in the Keep, and deliver item and Audiovisual Conservator on demand, updating the Conservation List with dates of delivery.
6. Rose Library liaison and Audiovisual Conservator will discuss the estimated return date.
7. Once returned, the Rose Library liaison will update the Conservation List, the rights statement, and Keep metadata as well as create digital access object tags in the encoded finding aid.  Research Services staff will be notified if the transaction is patron driven. 
8. Rose Library liaison will return materials to shelf

### 12.4 Pest Management

The Rose Library preservation liaison is responsible for monitoring bug traps on L9-L11.
* Once a month, the preservation liaison should inspect all bug traps on L9-L11 and replace any traps as needed.
* Notify the Conservator if more replacement traps are needed.
* The Conservator maintains a [centralized pest management spreadsheet](https://emory-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ebrow38_emory_edu/EUIliMUVCK1PtQC5oouiHekB_Bt_7SZIrxIJYjSpJVMG4w?e=moARGZ) to track pest traps in the Woodruff Library building.
  	* The locations of all bug traps on L9-L11 are noted in the "Rose trap locations" tab. Update the date on the spreadsheet when a trap is replaced.
  	* When bugs are found in a trap or elsewhere, note it on the spreadsheet on the "Rose" tab, including the date, location, and kind of bug.


Updates to this spreadsheet will be monitored by the Conservator, who is responsible for communicating with facilities (Le'Denna Harris) and the pest management company. **The preservation liaison should notify the Conservator and Le'Denna Harris immediately if there are any major pest issues that require immediate attention.**

### 12.5 Environmental Monitoring

Dataloggers are located on L9-L11 and monitored by Preservation staff. Preservation staff sends monthly environmental reports to Rose Library staff each month and an annual report at the end of the calendar year. Rose staff should review to ensure that there have been no significant changes to temperatures and relative humidity over the course of the reporting period. These reports then get filed in a OneDrive folder: EUV Rose Library > Cataloging and Collection Processing > Preservation > Environmental Reports.
