### 11.1 Photographs

Archivists will use the following guidelines and their professional discretion to determine appropriate levels of arrangement and description for photographs in Rose Library collections. These guidelines are meant to offer general guidance for archivists working with photographs, though there are a few prescriptive rules.

There are many factors to consider when deciding on a processing level for photographs: context of acquisition; context of creation; fragility and conservation needs; relationship to other material in the collection; informational, evidential, and artifactual value; and presence of identifying information. Photographs are a growing collecting priority for the Rose Library and the rationale for selecting a collection is an important factor in determining processing level for photographs. At the Rose Library, we acquire photographs in three broad contexts: 1) as one part of a larger collection documenting an individual or organization; 2) collections of fine art photography by a single photographer; or 3) as part of a collection of photographs documenting a single subject and collected specifically because they are photographs. 

In collections where photographs are only one part, the photographic value of the material is usually incidental. In these cases, item level arrangement and description is almost never warranted. Photographs can be arranged and described at the file level and will mostly not be sleeved. Photographs that are attached to paper documents or part of subject files should be left in their original locations (see Restriction and Separation for additional guidance on when and how to separate photos). If photos are put at increased risk of degradation because of their proximity to newsprint or other formats in a subject file, use folder inserts to segregate the photographs. Early or rare photographic formats may require additional considerations, even in a mixed format collection. Fragile photographs should always be sleeved and stored with care.

Collections of fine art photography will likely require more item level arrangement and/or description than mixed format collections. Photographs in these collections should always be sleeved and images that are too large to be sleeved should be foldered individually. Many images will likely be foldered and described individually, but it is acceptable to folder and describe groups of photographs together when appropriate (for example, images from the same session or series). These collections may contain multiple generations of an image (i.e. negatives, contact sheets, and prints). These will likely depict slightly different versions of the image and should all be retained. Depending on size and original order, the different formats may be stored together or separately. If storing them separately, take care to describe them consistently.

Photograph collections that document a particular subject or subjects and are collected specifically because they are photographs (e.g. Langmuir) may also require more item level arrangement and/or description than a mixed format collection. These are likely to contain more early photographic formats such as glass plates and albumen prints. They are also likely to contain fewer groups of photographs with a joint provenance. Most additions will be individual items acquired from a rare book and manuscript dealer. When groups of photographs with a single provenance are acquired for addition to such a collection, these may be foldered and described together. Storage of large groups of snapshots and small format prints can be improved by first placing portions of the groups in envelopes before foldering. Two envelopes will fit in one folder. Every photograph need not be sleeved in these collections. Older formats and fragile photos should always be sleeved.

For help identifying photographic formats or guidance on processing formats not mentioned here, see [Graphics Atlas](<http://www.graphicsatlas.org/> "http://www.graphicsatlas.org/"); Mary Lynn Ritzenthaler and Diane Vogt O'Connor, Photographs: Archival Care and Management; and Sylvie Pénichon, Twentieth Century Color Photographs: Identification and Care. 

### 11.1.1 General rules:

* Wash hands before handling photographic material in any format (wearing gloves is not necessary if hands are clean)
* Handle photographic material by the edges only
* Plastic sleeves are acceptable for most photographic formats except:
	* Photos with lifting emulsions or edge frills (use paper four-flap wrappers instead to minimize surface contact)
	* Unstable materials such as cellulose nitrate or cellulose acetate negatives (use paper envelopes instead) 
	* Polaroids (use paper envelopes instead)
* When sleeving, insert photographs with the emulsion layer facing away from any seams
* Sleeve items individually regardless of format
* Photographs may never be stored in glassine; when processing, photographs must be removed from any old glassine envelopes present in the collection
* Photographs can be stored upright; oversized photographs and particularly fragile photographs should be stored flat
* Like sizes should be stored together to create even pressure in boxes; if a box contains multiple sizes and materials are slumping or bending, cardboard can be inserted between folders to create more stability (consult with preservation liaison first)
* Avoid using paperclips and plastiklips on photographs whenever possible
* Folder inserts or paper envelopes can be used to keep together a subset of photographs within a folder### 6.3.2 Labeling photographs:

### 11.1.2 Labeling photographs: 

Labeling photographs should be rare. However, if you can identify the subject or subjects of the image and the photo is only one among many in a folder, writing the information lightly on the back of the photograph is an acceptable option.

* Place on a smooth, hard, flat surface; soft surfaces may cause impressions in the emulsion
* DO NOT use ink to label photographs, even supposedly archival pens marketed for photograph labeling
* Use a #2 pencil or softer or a Stabilo all graphite pencil
* Write lightly on the back of the image along the border only
* Exerting too much pressure will damage the emulsion
* Resin coated (RC) photo papers will not accept pencil; use paper or folder inserts to record any annotations
* DO NOT mark transparencies, direct positives, film negatives, or cased images
* Enclose the information in brackets to indicate it is archivist supplied information

### 11.1.3 Describing photographs: 

* Archivist devised titles should include:
	* Main subjects depicted, i.e., persons, events, activities, and objects
	* Geographical location, if known and significant
	* Date or date spans of what is being depicted 
	* Photographer, if known 
* Transcribe photographer supplied titles when describing fine art photographs (further description can be provided in a file level scope and content note if warranted)
* For images in photograph collections such as Langmuir (i.e., description is primarily item level and photographs are often unidentifiable by archivists), provide as much description for unidentified images as possible
	* For example, "Food service or domestic worker holding a kitten…"
	* Depending on the collection, you may also consider including race and gender information in the title
* Include format in the description when relevant (when describing early photographic processes or other rare formats)
* It is not necessary to include measurements/dimensions

### 11.1.4 19th Century paper prints:

* Should be sleeved
* DO NOT attempt to remove an image from its mount
* Unmounted albumen prints are prone to curling and cupping; insert an alkaline board behind the image inside the plastic sleeve to provide adequate support

### 11.1.5 Glass and metal plates:

* If uncased, store in a four-flap wrapper
* Store upright on long edge
* DO NOT store glass plates flat
* DO NOT allow to slant
* DO NOT touch the image layer
* DO NOT attempt to clean, repair, or flatten glass or metal plates
* Boxes that contain a significant number of glass plates should be marked as heavy and fragile

### 11.1.6 Color photographs:

* Color photographs are highly unstable and subject to color loss even in the dark
* Most color photographs can be stored according to the general rules above
* Polaroids should be stored in unbuffered envelopes rather than plastic (regular acid-free folders are on the high end of the appropriate pH for Polaroids; if not sleeving images individually, they should still be stored in an unbuffered envelope inside a folder)

### 11.1.7 Photograph albums:

* Photo albums should not be dismantled unless photographs have already started to release from pages
* If dismantling an album, take care to keep photographs in order using envelopes or folder inserts
* If pages have been disbound but photographs are still adhered, sleeve the individual pages and then folder or box as a unit
* Small albums that will fit in a folder may be stored in a Hollinger box or record center carton (preferably spine down)
* Larger albums should be stored flat in a box no more than one inch larger than the album on either side (see Head of Collection Processing to order boxes that will fit if none are on hand)

### 11.1.8 Slides and transparencies:

* Slide is usually the original negative
* Store in plastic slide pages
* If collection contains a significant number of slides, acid free three-ring binder boxes can be used for permanent storage

### 11.1.9 Negatives:

* Negatives can be sleeved in plastic
* Follow the general guidance for deciding to sleeve photographs when deciding whether or not to sleeve negatives

### 11.1.10 Nitrate film:

* Should be stored at temps below 50 with a RH of 30-40% at minimum
* Should always be stored in paper to prevent build-up of unstable gasses

### 11.1.11 Cellulose acetate film:

* Cellulose acetates shrink as they age and display vinegar syndrome
* Cellulose acetates should also be stored in alkaline buffered paper envelopes or sleeves and placed in cold storage

### 11.2 Audiovisual materials

### 11.3 Born-digital materials

This section is under construction and will eventually contain detailed instructions for imaging, processing, and preserving born-digital content. For now, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/digital-archives">Rose Library Digital Archives Manual</a>.

### 11.4 Web archives
Web archives are a type of born-digital content but have unique acquisition and management processes. For policies and workflows, see the <a href="https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/digital-archives/blob/master/web_archives.md">Web Archives section of the Digital Archives manual</a>.

#### Accessioning Web Archives 
**(Note: This section should be reviewed for alignment and possible consolidation with general accessioning documentation.)**

The Rose Library maintains accession records for all new web crawls. If a website is part of a larger gift or purchase, create an accession record for the website and one for the remainder of the materials. Separate paperwork for the website is not necessary as long as the original deed covers web capture, but the accession record for both should link to the same paperwork.  If a website is captured per the suggestion of Rose Library curators or processing staff, an accession record should be generated to record the reasoning behind the capture, but no other paperwork is required. 

Accession records for archived websites should be made after the seed has been crawled and added to Archive-it so that the seed identifier can be added to the content description in the accession record. Accession records do not need to be updated for subsequent crawls of the same seed.   

The following metadata fields are designed to work in tandem with policies and guidelines outlined in the Rose Library collection services manual:
* Title (required). Supply a DACS-compliant title for the accession.  The title should be formed in accordance to the rules outlined in the Description section of the Rose Library collection services manual.  For archived websites, the title should include the name of the website and “website crawl” (e.g. Alice Walker’s Garden website crawl).
* Identifier (required). All collection material is assigned a unique accession number, consisting of the year, the month, and the next accession number in sequence for the month [e.g. 2017-06-34].
* Accession date (required). This field will pre-populate the current date.  This date should match the day the accession record was originally created and the accession number assigned.
* Content Description (required). Describe the content and context of the materials for the accession.  Include a description of the archived website, including subject(s) covered, the creator and content of the website, date(s) of creation if apparent, and the context of the website in the overall collection (where applicable).  The content description should also include the ArchiveIt initial crawl date and a link to the website in the ArchiveIt wayback machine [e.g. https://wayback.archive-it.org/6326/*/http://alicewalkersgarden.com].
* Provenance (required). The source from which the repository acquired the archived website. When the provenance of an accession is unknown, indicate so (e.g. There is no documentation concerning the provenance of these materials).  Optionally, add any other known information about the custodial history of the collection including the original seed URL, scoping rules, and site IDs.
Example: Original URL was selected by curators (possibly Pellom McDaniels) and captured through the use of Archive-It in 2012. In 2019, the URL changed and was added to Archive-it by Elizabeth Russey Roke. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website.
* General note (required). Use this field to record the crawl frequency (e.g. one-time).
* Acquisition type (required). Select the “Web Capture” resource type from the drop-down menu.
* Resource type (required). Select the nature of the archival collection according to DACS guidance: papers, collection, or records.
* Restrictions apply? (required when applicable). Check box if use or access restrictions are present in the crawled website.
* Access Restrictions (required when applicable). If the website is restricted from access, check this box.  Access restrictions are rarely applied for websites, but possibilities include downloaded WARC files, crawls of sites requiring authentication, or manual captures of sensitive content.  Archive-It crawls cannot be restricted.
* Access Restrictions Note (required when applicable). Describe the restriction here.  If this field is in use, it must include a termination date.
* Use Restrictions (required when applicable). If any portion of the accession is restricted from certain kinds of use, check this box. Use restrictions apply in cases where special software is needed to render or view the capture.
* Use Restrictions Note (required). For all archived websites:
  * This collection is protected by copyright and/or related rights. You are free to use materials in the collection in any way that is permitted by the copyright and related rights legislation that applies to your use. For other uses you need to obtain permission from the rights-holder(s).
* Dates (required). For type, select single if an ongoing capture (enter the month and year of first capture) or inclusive if the website is defunct and/or no longer captured (enter the month and year of first and last captures).
* Extents (required). The following guidelines are for hosted captures (e.g. Archive-It).  If the accession consists of WARC files or other derivatives stored in a general preservation system, a parallel extent statement for size in MB/GB (combined with any other born-digital material counted in MB/GB) should be added.
  * Portion: Whole
  * Number: Number of websites captured
  * Type: websites
* Related resource (required). Link the accession to its corresponding resource record/parent collection.  
* Agents (required if applicable). Add an agent link for the creator(s) of the website.
* External Documents (required if applicable). If the acquisition is donor-initiated (e.g. part of the deed of gift or other acquisitions paperwork), use this field to link to relevant external documentation.
  * Title: Copy the title of the document from OneDrive/SharePoint
  * Location: Copy and paste the link to the document.

#### Describing Web Archives
Once a website has been crawled by Archive-It and accessioned in ArchivesSpace, create descriptive information about the website in the ArchivesSpace resource record and in Archive-It. In general, ArchivesSpace is the database of record for descriptive metadata. Archive-It should duplicate information necessary for discovery and access and to be consistent with LIBSAFE Go, Emory Digital Collections, and other repositories, but does not serve as the authoritative descriptive record.

##### ArchivesSpace
If the collection as a whole is processed at the collection level or consists entirely of archived web content, archival objects representing web archives will be at the top level of the structure. If the collection is processed at the series level or more granularly, place the archival objects where they fit best intellectually. 

For websites captured using Archive-It, create one file-level archival object for each seed, complete the fields listed below, and add a corresponding digital object as an instance. For websites archived using tools other than Archive-It, the same information should be recorded in the finding aid, although WARC files containing content from multiple sites/seeds may be described in aggregate using a single file-level AO and DO record when appropriate. 

Regardless of the capture tool and level of description, the digital object that serves as the instance for each archival object should point to the repository where the packaged content is stored (e.g., Archive-It or LIBSAFE Go) and follow any additional applicable guidelines (e.g., Component Unique ID and other metadata fields used for content in LIBSAFE Go).

This section includes guidelines and examples specific to web archives, but all description in ArchivesSpace should align with overall Rose Library policies. For additional instructions and fields not covered here, see the [general guidelines](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/06-DESCRIPTION#611-main-entrycreator).

Required elements for web archives described in ArchivesSpace resource records:
* Title (file level)
  * The name by which the website is known, in italics if the official title, followed by “[web archive]” (see 10.7.4.1 Digital media controlled vocabulary). If unclear, the archivist may derive a title from the page source (look for “title” in the metadata) or devise one using a brief description of the website content. Groups of websites represented as a single archival object are described in aggregate.
  * Examples:
    * Alice Walker: The Official Website [web archive]
    * Statements and open letters [web archive]
* Dates (file level)
  * One-time capture:
    * Type: Single
    * Begin date: Month and year of capture
  * Ongoing captures:
    * Type: Inclusive
    * Begin date: Year and month of first capture
    * End date: Leave blank
    * Date expression: [First crawl date]-ongoing (e.g., “2012 May-ongoing”)
  * Multiple captures but no longer crawling:
    * Type: Inclusive
    * Begin date: Year and month of first capture
    * End date: Year and month of last capture
* Agents (file level)
  * Creator:
    * The organization or person principally responsible for creating the intellectual content of an archived website.
    * If the website has the same creator as the entire collection, the collection-level creator entry is sufficient.
    * If the creator of the archived website is different from the collection as a whole, add the creator as an agent at the file level with the role of “Creator.”
    * Form this field according to DACS guidelines and use headings from LCNAF when possible.
    * If the author/publisher is unknown, or if you are describing a group of archived websites from various creators, do not add a creator.
  * Source:
    * For websites captured by Rose Library staff, add “Emory University. Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library.” as an agent with the role of “Source” and the relator “Collector.”
* Extent (collection level)
  * Add the number of sites to the appropriate container summary (e.g., “1 archived website”) and include the volume of captured web content (in MB/GB) as part of the extent subrecord.
  * For ongoing crawls, the storage volume count will quickly become outdated. If you have reason to revisit a collection, consider revising the extent, but at this time we do not systematically update this field.
* Abstract (collection level)
  * Add a mention of archived websites to the abstract if they are sizeable and/or have significant research value.
* Scope and content note (collection and file level)
  * At the collection/series/subseries level, as appropriate, make sure the note includes archived web content.
  * At the file level, add a brief scope and content note explaining the content and context of the archived website. Note any limitations or possible content exclusions based on capture technology or QA processes.
* Custodial history (collection and file level)
  * If the collection has multiple archived websites, record seed-specific details at the file level and a brief overview at the collection level. If the collection has only one archived website or if there are multiple but they share the same custodial history, a collection-level note is sufficient.
  * Briefly describe how the material was captured: who initiated and/or oversaw the capture, the tool(s) used, an overview of the capture timeline (start date, one-time vs. ongoing, frequency), and any unusual circumstances or specific context around the capture. 
* Appraisal note (collection level)
  * Record who selected the site for crawling (if known) along with their title. May also include reasons for crawling, if not obvious, and notes about seed scoping decisions. A collection-level note is sufficient unless the collection contains multiple web archives with significantly different appraisal processes and decisions.
  * Examples:
    * Selected for capture and acquisition by Katherine Fisher, Head of Digital Archives, in consultation with Randy Gue, Assistant Director of Collection Development and Curator of Political, Cultural, and Social Movements.
    * Selected for capture and acquisition by John Bence, Assistant Director and University Archivist.
    * Rose Library acquired the web archives as part of a larger group of digital materials selected by the donor. Katherine Fisher, Head of Digital Archives, assisted with capture at the donor’s request.
    * Websites identified for archiving by various Rose Library staff and selected for crawling by Katherine Fisher, Head of Digital Archives, based on technical feasibility.
* Conditions governing access and use (collection and file level)
  * Not typically used for web archives, especially those crawled and accessed using Archive-It. If needed for content acquired through other workflows and tools, follow general guidelines for documenting restrictions.
* Digital object record
  * Add a DO as an instance for each web archive AO. Follow the [guidelines for describing digital content](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EmoryUniversityLibraries/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B25158557-429B-4A4A-867C-F6FE6FD0946D%7D&file=Metadata%20Guidelines%20for%20Digital%20Archival%20Objects%20in%20ArchivesSpace%20at%20Emory.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).
  * Summary of requirements:
    * Title: Repeat from AO
    * Identifier: For Archive-It crawls, enter the Wayback URL for the list of captures. Example: https://wayback.archive-it.org/6326/*/https://opendoorcommunity.org/. For captures stored elsewhere, enter the equivalent PID/item link.
    * Date: Repeat from AO
    * File URI (for file version): Link to access version, if different from above. Repeat above URL if also used for access.
    * Caption: Enter “Digital file available.” (Unless restrictions apply, then see DO guidelines for appropriate caption as well as file version handling.)
    * Publish both the DO and the file version.

##### Archive-It 
Selected metadata entered in Archive-It should be transcribed to the finding aid to support management and integration.

Note that collection-level metadata for Archive-It collections should not be changed. These collections exist for administrative purposes and do not correspond with provenance-based collections in ArchivesSpace. Seeds within the Archive-It collections are associated with various archival collections and ArchivesSpace resource records.

Seed-level metadata in Archive-It describes individual websites and their captures. This metadata can be searched/browsed in Archive-It’s front-end interface (link), although ArchivesSpace remains the system of record for descriptive metadata and the primary access point for archived websites. 

For more information about how to add seed-level metadata (including batch edits) in Archive-It, see the Archive-It Help Center.

Complete the following fields for each seed, skipping other fields available in Archive-It:
* Title (“Title” field in Archive-It): Must match AO title.
* Call Number (custom field in Archive-It): Collection identifier formatted as in Cor (e.g., "MSS 930")
* Holding Repository (custom field in Archive-It): Choose from controlled list (Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library; Emory University. General Libraries; Pitts Theology Library; Oxford College Library (Oxford, Ga.); Robert W. Woodruff Health Science Center. Library; MacMillan Law Library; Emory University Archives).
* Creator (“Creator” field in Archive-It): Use LCNAF when possible.
* Date Created (“Date” field in Archive-It): Describe the dates of the capture (year + month), not the site itself. Enter as a single date or range, using ISO 8601 date format, which calls for a forward slash separating start and end dates. Example: 2012-02/2022-12
* Primary Language (“Language” field in Archive-It): Assume English unless another language is known to be present. Use ISO 639-2 Code (e.g., eng).
* Rights Statement (custom field in Archive-It)
  * If Emory owns the site: © Emory University. This online edition is made available for individual viewing and reference for educational purposes only. To request permission for further re-use, please contact the Rose Library at rose.library@emory.edu.
  * If someone else owns the site: Emory University does not control copyright for this work. This online edition is made available for individual viewing and reference for educational purposes only, such as personal study, preparation for teaching, and research. Your reproduction, distribution, public display or other re-use of any content beyond a fair use as codified in section 107 of US Copyright Law or other applicable privilege is at your own risk.  It is your sole responsibility to investigate the copyright status of a work and obtain permission when needed.
* Rightsstatement.org statement (“Rights” field in Archive-It): Enter https://rightsstatements.org/page/InC/1.0/ in most cases.
* ArchivesSpace ID (“Identifier” field in Archive-It): Copy and paste the ArchivesSpace ref ID from the archival object record.
* Accession Number (custom field in Archive-It): Record the accession number assigned when the site/crawl was accessioned.
