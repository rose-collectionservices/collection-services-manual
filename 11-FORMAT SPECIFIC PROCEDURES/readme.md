### 11.1 Photographs

Archivists will use the following guidelines and their professional discretion to determine appropriate levels of arrangement and description for photographs in Rose Library collections. These guidelines are meant to offer general guidance for archivists working with photographs, though there are a few prescriptive rules.

There are many factors to consider when deciding on a processing level for photographs: context of acquisition; context of creation; fragility and conservation needs; relationship to other material in the collection; informational, evidential, and artifactual value; and presence of identifying information. Photographs are a growing collecting priority for the Rose Library and the rationale for selecting a collection is an important factor in determining processing level for photographs. At the Rose Library, we acquire photographs in three broad contexts: 1) as one part of a larger collection documenting an individual or organization; 2) collections of fine art photography by a single photographer; or 3) as part of a collection of photographs documenting a single subject and collected specifically because they are photographs. 

In collections where photographs are only one part, the photographic value of the material is usually incidental. In these cases, item level arrangement and description is almost never warranted. Photographs can be arranged and described at the file level and will mostly not be sleeved. Photographs that are attached to paper documents or part of subject files should be left in their original locations (see Restriction and Separation for additional guidance on when and how to separate photos). If photos are put at increased risk of degradation because of their proximity to newsprint or other formats in a subject file, use folder inserts to segregate the photographs. Early or rare photographic formats may require additional considerations, even in a mixed format collection. Fragile photographs should always be sleeved and stored with care.

Collections of fine art photography will likely require more item level arrangement and/or description than mixed format collections. Photographs in these collections should always be sleeved and images that are too large to be sleeved should be foldered individually. Many images will likely be foldered and described individually, but it is acceptable to folder and describe groups of photographs together when appropriate (for example, images from the same session or series). These collections may contain multiple generations of an image (i.e. negatives, contact sheets, and prints). These will likely depict slightly different versions of the image and should all be retained. Depending on size and original order, the different formats may be stored together or separately. If storing them separately, take care to describe them consistently.

Photograph collections that document a particular subject or subjects and are collected specifically because they are photographs (e.g. Langmuir) may also require more item level arrangement and/or description than a mixed format collection. These are likely to contain more early photographic formats such as glass plates and albumen prints. They are also likely to contain fewer groups of photographs with a joint provenance. Most additions will be individual items acquired from a rare book and manuscript dealer. When groups of photographs with a single provenance are acquired for addition to such a collection, these may be foldered and described together. Storage of large groups of snapshots and small format prints can be improved by first placing portions of the groups in envelopes before foldering. Two envelopes will fit in one folder. Every photograph need not be sleeved in these collections. Older formats and fragile photos should always be sleeved.

### 11.1.1 General rules:

* Wash hands before handling photographic material in any format (wearing gloves is not necessary if hands are clean)
* Handle photographic material by the edges only
* Plastic sleeves are acceptable for most photographic formats except:
	* Photos with lifting emulsions or edge frills (use paper four-flap wrappers instead to minimize surface contact)
	* Unstable materials such as cellulose nitrate or cellulose acetate negatives (use paper envelopes instead) 
	* Polaroids (use paper envelopes instead)
* When sleeving, insert photographs with the emulsion layer facing away from any seams
* Sleeve items individually regardless of format
* Photographs may never be stored in glassine; when processing, photographs must be removed from any old glassine envelopes present in the collection
* Photographs can be stored upright; oversized photographs and particularly fragile photographs should be stored flat
* Like sizes should be stored together to create even pressure in boxes; if a box contains multiple sizes and materials are slumping or bending, cardboard can be inserted between folders to create more stability (consult with preservation liaison first)
* Avoid using paperclips and plastiklips on photographs whenever possible
* Folder inserts or paper envelopes can be used to keep together a subset of photographs within a folder### 6.3.2 Labeling photographs:

### 11.1.2 Labeling photographs: 

Labeling photographs should be rare. However, if you can identify the subject or subjects of the image and the photo is only one among many in a folder, writing the information lightly on the back of the photograph is an acceptable option.

* Place on a smooth, hard, flat surface; soft surfaces may cause impressions in the emulsion
* DO NOT use ink to label photographs, even supposedly archival pens marketed for photograph labeling
* Use a #2 pencil or softer or a Stabilo all graphite pencil
* Write lightly on the back of the image along the border only
* Exerting too much pressure will damage the emulsion
* Resin coated (RC) photo papers will not accept pencil; use paper or folder inserts to record any annotations
* DO NOT mark transparencies, direct positives, film negatives, or cased images
* Enclose the information in brackets to indicate it is archivist supplied information

### 11.1.3 Describing photographs: 

* Archivist devised titles should include:
	* Main subjects depicted, i.e., persons, events, activities, and objects
	* Geographical location, if known and significant
	* Date or date spans of what is being depicted 
	* Photographer, if known 
* Transcribe photographer supplied titles when describing fine art photographs (further description can be provided in a file level scope and content note if warranted)
* For images in photograph collections such as Langmuir (i.e., description is primarily item level and photographs are often unidentifiable by archivists), provide as much description for unidentified images as possible
	* For example, "Food service or domestic worker holding a kitten…"
	* Depending on the collection, you may also consider including race and gender information in the title
* Include format in the description when relevant (when describing early photographic processes or other rare formats)
* It is not necessary to include measurements/dimensions

### 11.1.4 19th Century paper prints:

* Should be sleeved
* DO NOT attempt to remove an image from its mount
* Unmounted albumen prints are prone to curling and cupping; insert an alkaline board behind the image inside the plastic sleeve to provide adequate support

### 11.1.5 Glass and metal plates:

* If uncased, store in a four-flap wrapper
* Store upright on long edge
* DO NOT store glass plates flat
* DO NOT allow to slant
* DO NOT touch the image layer
* DO NOT attempt to clean, repair, or flatten glass or metal plates
* Boxes that contain a significant number of glass plates should be marked as heavy and fragile

### 11.1.6 Color photographs:

* Color photographs are highly unstable and subject to color loss even in the dark
* Most color photographs can be stored according to the general rules above
* Polaroids should be stored in unbuffered envelopes rather than plastic (regular acid-free folders are on the high end of the appropriate pH for Polaroids; if not sleeving images individually, they should still be stored in an unbuffered envelope inside a folder)

### 11.1.7 Photograph albums:

* Photo albums should not be dismantled unless photographs have already started to release from pages
* If dismantling an album, take care to keep photographs in order using envelopes or folder inserts
* If pages have been disbound but photographs are still adhered, sleeve the individual pages and then folder or box as a unit
* Small albums that will fit in a folder may be stored in a Hollinger box or record center carton (preferably spine down)
* Larger albums should be stored flat in a box no more than one inch larger than the album on either side (see Head of Collection Processing to order boxes that will fit if none are on hand)

### 11.1.8 Slides and transparencies:

* Slide is usually the original negative
* Store in plastic slide pages
* If collection contains a significant number of slides, acid free three-ring binder boxes can be used for permanent storage

### 11.1.9 Negatives:

* Negatives can be sleeved in plastic
* Follow the general guidance for deciding to sleeve photographs when deciding whether or not to sleeve negatives

### 11.1.10 Nitrate film:

* Should be stored at temps below 50 with a RH of 30-40% at minimum
* Should always be stored in paper to prevent build-up of unstable gasses

### 11.1.11 Cellulose acetate film:

* Cellulose acetates shrink as they age and display vinegar syndrome
* Cellulose acetates should also be stored in alkaline buffered paper envelopes or sleeves and placed in cold storage
