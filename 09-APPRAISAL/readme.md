Appraisal is the process of identifying and selecting material of permanent, archival value to be accessioned and retained by a repository. 

Appraisal decisions may be based on a number of factors, including the records' provenance and content, authenticity and reliability, order and completeness, condition and costs to preserve them, and intrinsic value. Appraisal is guided by institutional mission statement and collecting policies.  The most important criteria for saving records are how well they document or explain the functions and activities of the creating unit, or how clearly they record the goals, beliefs, actions, motives, or creative process of an individual.  

Appraisal strategies can range from very broad cross-institutional or national documentation strategies to weeding individual items from folders.  In Collection Services, we focus on the identification of broad content areas and document types within collections that are of value and should be retained by the library.  We avoid weeding individual items as much as possible. 

High level appraisal decisions should be documented in the accessions database, detailed in the processing plan, and included in the finding aid in an APPRAISAL NOTE.

## 9.1 Before Processing

Ideally appraisal should take place prior to the collection material being transferred to the library and should begin not with an inspection of the records themselves, but with an analysis of the activities of the records creator.  The collecting curator or archivist will have a sense of what activities we are interested in documenting, and they will identify the records that document those activities or functions.  The collecting curator or archivist will only transfer permanently valuable records to the repository.   

While surveying the collection during accessioning or prior to detailed processing, archivists should identify large caches of duplicates, publications, or out of scope material and consult with the collecting curator about removing these items from the collection.  These recommendations and decisions should be recorded in the accessions database and/or in the processing plan.   

## 9.2 During Arrangement

While most of the selection decisions have been made prior to beginning the processing of a collection, inevitably some appraisal activity will happen in the course of arrangement and description.  Before undertaking work on a collection, archivists should have a conversation with the curator or staff member who brought in the collection to get a better sense of why they chose to acquire the materials:  

* What aspects of this person's or organization's work are we trying to document?   
* How does the collection relate to the Rose Library's holdings as a whole? 
* How does it advance our collecting strengths or support research in our community?   
* What types of material are superfluous to achieving our documentation goals?   

Some of these questions may be answered by the documentation that curators create during acquisition.  However, follow up conversations are usually valuable for gleaning additional information and insights not recorded in existing documentation. 

As you work through a collection it will become clear that some of the material included in the accession does not merit long-term preservation and can be removed.  This may be because it is duplicative, it does not have lasting historical value, or it does not reflect the core functions or activities that we are trying to document.  The following are examples of types of material that are routinely removed from a collection: 

* Duplicates that do not contain marginal notes or other added information (one copy is retained); 
* Large groups of routine or repetitive form letters or requests; 
* Large groupings of routine invitations; 
* Tickets, receipts, and business cards;
* Mass mailings;
* Checks/Cancelled checks;
* Catalogs and publications received from organizations outside of our collecting scope;
* Equipment and supply records, including manuals;
* Widely available publications or portions thereof unless annotated or about the creator;
* Material such as routine personal, financial, and medical records that have personally identifying information and present privacy concerns, but do not have substantial informational or transactional value. 

This list is neither comprehensive nor proscriptive. Appraisal decisions should always be made in the context of the collection being processed.  Records or documents that you discard from one collection may be important in the context of another.  For example, routine financial records such as canceled checks may become important in a collection of business records that otherwise has incomplete financial records. 

Retain empty postal envelopes that include return addresses.  These can be arranged at the end of a group of correspondence as "Envelopes, empty." This is by request of the curators.

Appraisal activity should take place at the same level as arrangement activity, generally the series, subseries, or file level.  Individual items should not be weeded from files.  Since most processing will take place on a series or file level, such material within existing folders is unlikely to be identified and removed as part of processing.  This is time consuming, provides no additional value or clarity to researchers, and may disrupt context.  Appraisal strategy should be focused on large aggregates of material that are duplicative or do not have enduring value.   

Appraisal decisions should always be made in conjunction with your supervisor and the curator who oversees the associated collecting area.  Any material removed from a collection over the course of processing should be set aside to review with the collecting curator.  Final disposition decisions will be informed by institutional policies and curatorial practices. 

## 9.3 Working with Curators and Scheduling Reviews

Appraisal work is a shared responsibility between curators and archivists and should be an ongoing dialogue between collecting and processing staff.  The curatorial team makes the initial decisions about whether or not to acquire all or part of an individual’s papers or an organization’s records.  Once a collection has entered the repository, it may be appropriate for archivists to recommend additional appraisal decisions during accessioning or while processing the collection.  These appraisal recommendations should be included in the processing plan and discussed with the collecting curator.  Any items that are removed from a collection over the course of processing should be retained to be reviewed with the curator before being discarded. 

It is important to remember that while archivists at the Rose rarely separate materials from collections based on their content, relevance, condition, or other factors, they do perform appraisal on collections when they make decisions about the levels to which to arrange, describe, and preserve collections. Archival appraisal is, at heart, the application of value to materials, an activity that is fundamental to processing. 
 
## 9.4 Procedures for Discarding Material
In many cases, materials will be sent to the Rose Library that do not fit in the collecting areas and will not be added to the collection.  During the donation process, donors have the option to identify how they would like dispose of the materials within the deed paperwork.  While some donors are content to have us dispose of the materials, others are less comfortable with the destruction of these items. If the deed requires a return of materials or if there is no information on disposition, the materials should be reviewed by the curator of the collecting area for return to the donor or their family.

**If the deed allows for disposition by the library, and:**
- The materials hold no research value (and deed/paperwork allows for disposition of materials), the archivist can destroy materials via the confidential shred bin.
	- Material removed from collections should be disposed of in a secure manner.  If at all possible collection material should be placed in the confidential shredding bins in the processing area, or, for AV or born digital material, the AV shredding bin.  Material that does not fit in the bin or that cannot be disposed of in that manner (e.g., computer hardware) for any reason should be placed in opaque black trash bags.  You should never use your desk trash or recycling bins for collection material.  Items removed from collections must be discarded and cannot be adopted by staff members. 
- The materials have research value, but it doesn’t fit our collecting areas, the archivist can reach out to other organizations where the materials are a better fit and transfer materials to that repository.
- The materials hold no research value but may hold sentimental value to the donor or family, the archivist should plan to return materials.

**When the processing archivist identifies materials that should be sent to the donor/family, the archivist should:**
- Confirm disposal requirements in the deed/donor paperwork.  
- Email the curator of the collecting area (cc’ing Head of Collection Development) with the size of the return, link to the donation paperwork, donor/family name and contact information, and a short explanation of why the materials is being removed.

**The curator should:**
- Review the donation paperwork for disposition needs
- Review the materials for context
- Reach out to the donor/family (via email or letter) about the return and ask for preferred return type (FedEx, local drop off, etc.)
- Update the archivist when the initial contact is made
- Update the archivist with follow up information to start the shipping/return process

- The archivist is responsible for boxing and shipping the materials back
- The curator is responsible for in-person returns 

While most appraisal decisions will vary depending on the collection, there are certain born-digital items that should not typically be transferred to the library. These include computer peripherals (e.g., keyboards, mice, monitors) and networking hardware (e.g., routers, modems). In cases where the library acquires whole computers or laptops, all hardware and casing, with the important exception of any hard drives, can typically be disposed of once disk imaging is complete. Contact Jack Scott to arrange surplus pick-up.  

Dispose of casing and additional hardware only: 

* If they feature labels and markings intentionally added by the donor/creator that contribute significant meaning to the collection. These should not be labels or markings that simply denote ownership or give instruction on use or function (i.e., “Dorothy’s mouse” or “plug in here”). 
* In cases where the associated hardware is particularly old or obscure and it has been deemed likely, following consultation with the digital archivist, that this equipment will be required in order to access and transfer digital files from the associated hardware. 

If a donor has requested that we return separated material to them, conduct a review with the appropriate curator as usual, and then pack and prepare the material for return.  Write a memo to accompany the return explaining our rationale for separating and returning the material.  Include a copy in the collection file. Generally we will FedEx collection material to the donors, but, occasionally, curators will want to return separated material themselves; consult with curatorial staff about the most appropriate method of return.  The Accessioning Archivist can assist with arranging shipping. 

Discarding or returning unwanted collection material should take place promptly.  Generally, if the curator has not removed the material from the archivist's possession within one month, the archivist will return the material themselves or discard at their discretion.  

## 9.5 After Processing/Reappraisal

Good collection management practices include occasional review of a repository’s collections to assess their continuing value and their ongoing relevance to an institution’s mission and collecting policy.  At any point the Rose Library may reappraise collections or portions of collections to determine their continuing value.  

If it is determined that a collection or portion of a collection does not fit the scope of the repository's holdings or does not have sufficient research value, the collection or portion of a collection may be deaccessioned.  Additional guidance on best practices and ethical guidelines for deaccessioning collection material can be found in SAA’s [Guidelines for Reappraisal and Deaccessioning](http://www2.archivists.org/category/standards-status/saa-standards-approved). 

## 9.6 Deaccessioning

Deaccessioning is the process of removing materials or collections from the care and custody of the Rose Library.  Formal deaccessioning occurs because the material has been reappraised and found to be unsuitable for our holdings or because the legal owner has requested its return.  If the material is unsuitable for our repository it may be destroyed, returned to the donor, or transferred to a more appropriate repository.   

### 9.6.1 Deaccessioning Procedures
[Updated workflow (2024)](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Manuscript%20Collection%20Descriptions/_Deaccessioning/Deaccessioning%20Procedures_2024.docx?d=w0ac19f7bedff48d7b3d309faa3917922&csf=1&web=1&e=koVoKZ)
1. Write a memo to the collection file outlining disposition of collection, specifically including justification for deaccession. Template is located [here](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Manuscript%20Collection%20Descriptions/Deaccessioning/deaccession%20memo%20template.doc?d=w7ffdcd455bc64b068ff4183e62f6547b&csf=1&web=1&e=towyRh).
2. If transferring to another institution, complete the appropriate transfer form, located [here](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind/Gift%20Process%20Files%20and%20Forms?csf=1&web=1&e=6UcqAH). Use the Intra-institution form if transferring material to another Emory repository. Use the Inter-institution transfer form if transferring material to a non-Emory institution. 
3. Save electronic copies of the transfer form and memo to the Deaccessioning folder on [OneDrive](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Manuscript%20Collection%20Descriptions/Deaccessioning?csf=1&web=1&e=rYVyZs).
4. Place hard copies of transfer form and memo in the CL-2 file.
5. Update the shelf list by deleting the location and extent information for the collection and add a note in the note field indicating the disposition of the collection and the date.  Leave the line in the shelf list as a record that we did once have the collection.  The MSS number should not be reassigned to a new collection. 
6. In ArchivesSpace, add a Deaccession subrecord to the collection Resource record. In the “Description” field, link to the electronic deaccession memo in the Deaccessioning folder on Box. In the “Date” field, change type to single and enter the date of deaccession.
7. Add Deaccession information to the [Deaccession master list](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Manuscript%20Collection%20Descriptions/Deaccessioning/Deaccession%20master%20list.xls?d=wd89274f534a845feac43f3c04b6c7e12&csf=1&web=1&e=lZ5tUz).
8. Delete bibliographic records in OCLC and ALMA.
9. Delete EAD record in the finding aids database.
10. Alert staff that the collection has been deaccessioned. 

## 9.7 Appraisal of Born-Digital Material  

### 9.7.1 Pre-Acquisition Appraisal

While the general appraisal strategies described here also apply to born-digital materials, the nature of born-digital content and its transfer process raise some additional considerations. Our practice of creating forensic disk images whenever possible makes it more difficult to separate unwanted material from a single transfer of data once prepared for preservation storage. Similarly, we may acquire high-capacity storage media that will not be accessed until they reach the Digital Archives lab. For this reason, early conversations with donors and content creators are crucial. 

Curators and the digital archivist should use the [Pre-Acquisition Digital Assets Survey](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Digital%20Collections/Forms,%20Surveys,%20and%20Handouts/BD_survey.docx?d=w6d3f5b0c229f4be2ba818449d2a4e532&csf=1&web=1&e=QBzrzK) to guide conversations with donors, determine where the donor has digital assets, and record information about which of these should be transferred to the Rose Library. Information about the current technical environment in which digital assets are stored will also help the digital archivist prepare for transfer. Throughout this process, curators and the digital archivist should be in regular contact regarding information gathered from the donor and subsequent decisions regarding appraisal and transfer.  

While most appraisal decisions will vary depending on the collection, there are certain items that should not typically be transferred to the library. These include computer peripherals (e.g., keyboards, mice, monitors) and networking hardware (e.g., routers, modems). 

### 9.7.2 Post-Acquisition Appraisal

In cases where the library acquires whole computers or laptops, all hardware and casing, with the important exception of any hard drives, can typically be disposed of once disk imaging is complete. In cases where hardware and casing has been flagged for disposal, submit a ticket to Desktop Support (euhelp@emory.edu), cc-ing the Library's current Desktop Support Specialist, requesting that hardware and casing be collected for surplus. Small pieces of hardware and casing flagged for disposal can be stored in the Digital Archives Lab until a significant enough collection is ready to be moved to surplus.

Do not dispose of casing and additional hardware only: 

* If they feature labels and markings intentionally added by the donor/creator that contribute significant meaning to the collection. These should not be labels or markings that simply denote ownership or give instruction on use or function (i.e., “Dorothy’s mouse” or “plug in here”). 
* In cases where the associated hardware is particularly old or obscure and it has been deemed likely, following consultation with the digital archivist, that this equipment will be required in order to access and transfer digital files from the associated hardware.
