We collect data and conduct assessments to help us more effectively prioritize, plan, schedule, execute, and communicate the value of our work.   

## 11.1 Output Metrics and Statistics

We collect metrics on processing and cataloging outputs in order to help us better manage our work and to make realistic projections about the resources and time required for various projects.  The intent of a processing and cataloging metrics program is not to measure the productivity of individual staff or to evaluate performance. The intent is to measure processes, i.e., assessing the time and resources required to process collections or catalog print items, and the impacts of taking particular approaches. Data points can be used to estimate and project the staff and resources needed to conduct various projects and to help develop benchmarks. This information can also be used to justify staffing and the financial resources needed in the context of discussions with donors or when preparing grant applications. These numbers help us communicate the value of Collection Services' labor to administrators, colleagues, and donors.  

We report quarterly on our output statistics via the Collection Services quarterly reports and an annual report at the end of each fiscal year. Each person is responsible for managing their own stats and getting them to Head of Collection Services quarterly.

We keep statistics in the following areas:  

### 11.1.1 Accessioning

* Number of accessioned collections;
* Linear footage and OP/BV count of accessioned collections;
* Number of items for additions to miscellany or artificial collections.

We track these through ArchivesSpace and can generate reports as needed.

### 11.1.2 Processing

* Number of collections completed and in progress;
* Linear footage and OP/BV count processed each quarter;
* Level to which collection is arranged and described;
* Number of GB processed.

We track these statistics on a [spreadsheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Reports%20and%20Statistics/Collection%20Services/Manuscript%20Processing%20Statistics/Annual%20Processing%20Reports.xls?d=w7e8bdf8f65a54b8eb817bbc805493ae4&csf=1&web=1&e=JviidN).  Each person is responsible for managing their own stats and getting them to Head of Collection Services quarterly.  

### 11.1.3 Born-Digital Collections

* Born-digital acquisitions (amount transferred via imaging or file transfer in GB);
* Amount ingested into the Keep (in GB);
* Amount processed and made available in RR (in GB). 

We track these statistics in the [Master Shelf List](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/BoxDeletedUsers14/Shared%20Documents/aczebla_emory_edu/MARBL_Master%20SHELF%20LIST/Master%20shelf%20list.xls?d=w5e47b298820e4ed493f614b98b20e8c1&csf=1&web=1&e=GhjIw4) and a tab in the [annual processing report](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Reports%20and%20Statistics/Collection%20Services/Manuscript%20Processing%20Statistics/Annual%20Processing%20Reports.xls?d=w7e8bdf8f65a54b8eb817bbc805493ae4&csf=1&web=1&e=JviidN)

### 11.1.4 Cataloging (print)

* Number of new monograph titles;
* Number of monograph issues or volumes;
* Number of serial titles;
* Number of serial issues;
* Parent collection/collecting area (General monographs and serials, Danowski monographs and serials, Emory University Archives, and selected other project-based categories as needed).

We track these statistics on a [spreadsheet](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Reports%20and%20Statistics/Collection%20Services/Cataloging%20Statistics?csf=1&web=1&e=h94Gik)

Danowski and Billops-Hatch print cataloging statistics are also reported annually to their respective boards. 

### 11.1.5 Receiving

* Number of new acquisitions received;
* Number of purchases paid for;
* Number of purchases acquired and paid for within the same quarter and fiscal year;
* Number of gifts received and documented within the same quarter and fiscal year;
* Extents of material received.

The Accessioning Archivist tracks purchases and gifts in the [Acquisitions Receiving Logs](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Acquisitions%20Log?csf=1&web=1&e=OgfSLd). The Accessioning Archivist [compiles the collections receiving statistics](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Reports%20and%20Statistics/Collection%20Services/Collection%20Receiving%20Stats.xlsx?d=wb6581d8eed0c40a8be282a8c50f6a871&csf=1&web=1&e=76eI5M) based on that tracking. 

### 11.1.6 Emory Finding Aids and Alma

We also collect the following statistics by generating reports from EmoryFindingAids and Alma:

Cataloging (manuscripts):

* Number of MARC records created;
* Number of MARC records edited or updated.

EAD Finding aids:

* Number of new EAD finding aids;
* Number of EAD finding aids edited or updated.

## 11.2 Qualitative Assessments and Impact Statements

In addition to quantitative data and metrics, Collection Services also collects stories, anecdotes, and qualitative data around the work that we do and the positive impact that it has on our colleagues and our users.  This helps the unit to draft a broader narrative about our individual and shared work that includes not just what we hold and what we do, but that also communicates why it matters.    

## 11.3 Post-Processing Rights and Risk Assessment Report

Following file- or item-level processing on any collection, archivists must create a [post-processing rights and risk assessment report](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EbFuijkZKXlBlq5Bo124U_UBO33l08W2yHbPie62rwbvUQ?e=LbSr5w> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EbFuijkZKXlBlq5Bo124U_UBO33l08W2yHbPie62rwbvUQ?e=LbSr5w").

This report is a critical element of an approach to digitization and copyright analysis that centers risk assessment over item-level rights review. The document will be used to inform future decisions about the suitability of a collection for digitization based on risk factors that are often apparent during processing. The report template is designed to capture the knowledge of the processing archivist as it pertains to copyright and intellectual property at the point when that knowledge is at its peak. The goal is to collocate significant information about the collection's contents, various creators, intellectual property within the collection, and the archivists' knowledge of additional risk factors in a single report used to inform Rose Library's digitization strategy. Individuals proposing a digitization project will use the reports to determine whether all or portions of a collection are appropriate for digitization and as a starting point for securing permissions or crafting fair use justifications. 

The report should identify especially low and especially high-risk materials and their locations, document significant rights holders represented in the collection and whether any permissions have already been gathered, identify any aggregations of material potentially in the public domain, and document any additional risk factors (such as litigious donors/heirs) that should be considered during the proposal process. 

Archivists should be able to complete the report using internal tools, such as the [rights and risk matrix](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EgYegeuQ-lZLg7bfczr8g3sBxMmnZYIBdobzO3zuWawpxQ?e=0lvShT> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EgYegeuQ-lZLg7bfczr8g3sBxMmnZYIBdobzO3zuWawpxQ?e=0lvShT"), and basic copyright training. Most of the information necessary for the report should coincide with other types of information typically collected for description. For example, a list of primary rights holders should be similar to lists of significant correspondents, authors whose works are present in the collection, organizations that employed the collection creator, or other agents that would merit mention in a scope and contents note.

The report is not a fair use assessment, a digitization proposal, or a recommendation for digitization. However, it may be helpful in some instances to identify strong arguments in support of fair use, for example if digitization for education/instruction would be a transformative use of material created for a different purpose (i.e., business records).

To complete the report:
* First complete a collection-level assessment, including documenting any known permissions or high-level rights issues.
	* Copy and paste collection description from the completed finding aid.
	* Review the deed of gift for a license giving Rose Library permission to digitize and disseminate IP held by the collection donor. Older deeds will not include a clause like this and the specific language of the clause has evolved over time. The [deed template](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/ERNBWGTvj51HsxSpdpECWC8B85GVrqWkzRlM_VhJLbMdsA?e=JFupfA> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/ERNBWGTvj51HsxSpdpECWC8B85GVrqWkzRlM_VhJLbMdsA?e=JFupfA") can give you an idea of what kind of language you're looking for. You may attach a copy of the deed to the report document or copy and paste the clause from the deed into the appropriate section of the report template.
* Then conduct an assessment of each series separately. If the collection does not include series, the archivist should conduct an assessment of groups of homogenous materials , for example materials written by the same author, business records, or government records.
	* The [rights and risk matrix](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EgYegeuQ-lZLg7bfczr8g3sBxMmnZYIBdobzO3zuWawpxQ?e=0lvShT> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EgYegeuQ-lZLg7bfczr8g3sBxMmnZYIBdobzO3zuWawpxQ?e=0lvShT") will be especially helpful in conducting the series-level assessments. 
	* There is one matrix for manuscript collections and one for university archives collections. Each matrix includes tabs for the most common types of collections and record formats.
	* The x axis lists types of records, and the y axis lists various conditions governing copyright status. The point on the matrix where they meet will indicate the risk most likely associated with the documents in question.
* Thirdly, a final risk assessment should be completed.
	* This is a summary of the complete assessment. It should not repeat everything reported in other sections, but should be an at-a-glance distillation of the overall risk associated with the collection and the steps necessary to prepare for possible digitization . For example, a highly heterogeneous collection of a contemporary author including works that are heavily monetized and significant correspondence with famous acquaintances is like to be a high risk for digitization, whereas a collection of historical Emory University departmental records is likely to be a lower risk for digitization.
* Finally, a check list at the end of the template will allow the processing archivist to identify any work that has already been done to clear copyright or move digitization forward.
* Send a draft of the completed report to the Head of Collection Processing to review.
* After making any necessary changes, save a final copy of the report in the [Post-Processing Rights and Risk Assessments](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EnfHNhxgLv5Nm5-rJuNkosEByI5mIJkNA5CV03zPXoTYJQ?e=4DfcmK> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EnfHNhxgLv5Nm5-rJuNkosEByI5mIJkNA5CV03zPXoTYJQ?e=4DfcmK") folder on OneDrive and put a hard copy of the report in the collection file.
