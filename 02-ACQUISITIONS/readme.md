## 2.1 Precustodial work

Precustodial work occurs before a collection is received and paperwork completed.  It includes the selecting and acquisition of collection material which is the primary responsibility of the Curatorial team and most often refers to the intellectual work of identifying in-scope materials, working with donors, and the physical transfer of both materials and deeds/paperwork, the last two being the common point of intersection between the curatorial team and the processing team.  

**[Is this still done?]** Prior to discussion at the monthly collection strategies meeting, curators submit a Potential Acquisitions Report form [via this link for manuscript material](<https://airtable.com/shrFpKc5EDLllbV5j> "https://airtable.com/shrFpKc5EDLllbV5j") or [via this link for rare books](<https://airtable.com/shrsr8NWrF9B5F5Cx> "https://airtable.com/shrsr8NWrF9B5F5Cx"). A Word document will automatically appear in the [Potential Acquisitions Reports folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Potential%20Acquisitions%20Reports?csf=1&web=1&e=jwx8sV> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Potential%20Acquisitions%20Reports?csf=1&web=1&e=jwx8sV"). Curators and archivists may use the Potential Acquisitions Reports folder to upload additional relevant documentation for purchases under consideration, such as appraisal report, inventories, and operational impact statements.
	
Collection Services team members support curators in precustodial work, including the packing, shipping, and receiving of material (or arrangement thereof), as well as accepting the paperwork required to formally transfer a collection or item. While the curatorial team is primarily responsible for  precustodial work, Collection Services staff should be prepared to work with donors, vendors, and curators to provide guidance on any precustodial actions taken by the Library. 
	
### 2.1.1 Acquisitions v. Accessioning
For the purposes of this manual, **precustodial work** is the work done before materials are brought onsite and/or acquisition paper is signed, and while the term **acquisition** is a term used to describe curatorial work in developing collections, the Collection Services acquisitions workflow covers the overlap of the two departments primarily in identifying and tracking the requirements necessary for starting accessioning including:
*	Receiving  materials and signed paperwork
*	Initial accessioning documentation through ArchivesSpace
*	Documenting and tracking the status of the new materials
*	Storing materials that are not ready for accessioning

### 2.1.2 Curatorial Support
Prior to a collection being acquired by the Rose Library, the Curatorial team members may reach out to and consult with the Head of Processing to draft an [Operational Impact Statement](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Manuscript%20Processing%20Flags,%20Forms,%20and%20Templates/Operational%20Impact%20Template.docx?d=wd71816b5768b48e3bd3ba63cd914bd79&csf=1&web=1&e=9I9DqA>) to assess the overall space and supply needs of a collection, as well as cost of transfer, accessioning, processing, and storing a collection.  

Additionally, Collection Services staff may meet with donors or curators to provide guidance and assistance on matters such as: 
*	Packing and shipping support
	*	[14.4 Packing guidelines](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/14-ADMINISTRATIVE#144-packing-guidelines>);
   	*	[14.5 Moving and shipping collections](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/14-ADMINISTRATIVE#145-moving-and-shipping-collections>); and
     	*	[14.6 FedEx guidelines](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/14-ADMINISTRATIVE#146-fedex-guidelines>)
*	[Transfer of born-digital material](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/Born%20Digital%20Acquisitions%20Documents?csf=1&web=1&e=dQyJsr> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/Born%20Digital%20Acquisitions%20Documents?csf=1&web=1&e=dQyJsr")
*	Appraisal
*	Arrangement and description
*	Conservation
	
## 2.2 Acquisition workflow
*	The Head of Processing completes the acquisition process for manuscript collection materials
*	The Associate Director of Collection Services will oversee acquisitions of books. 
*	The University Archivist oversees the acquisition and transfer of University Archives materials.

Curators are responsible for completing paperwork for acquisitions and handing those documents off to either the Associate Director of Collection Services or the Head of Processing.

For acquisitions logs prior to the implementation of ArchivesSpace, please see the [Rose Acquisitions Log folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Acquisitions%20Log?csf=1&web=1&e=WILjX1> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Acquisitions%20Log?csf=1&web=1&e=WILjX1") on OneDrive.

### 2.2.1 Physical Transfer and Receiving 
*Collections receiving* is the physical transfer of the collection material from a donor, individual seller, or vendor to the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, & Rare Book Library. 

*	The primary point of contact for collections receiving for Emory University Archives at the Rose Library is the University Archivist. 
*	The primary point of contact for collections receiving for all other units at the Rose Library is the Associate Director of Collection Services (or, as a backup, the Head of Collection Processing).

All collection material should be received and opened by staff that did not arrange for the acquisition of the materials. This responsibility should most often fall to the Associate Director of Collection Services or the Head of Processing. **All packages delivered onsite will be delivered to the main Woodruff Library mailroom**, and mailroom staff will contact the Head of Processing for pickup or, if acquisition is small, deliver the materials to the tenth-floor mail spaces where the Associate Director of Collection Services will review materials and pass on to the Head of Processing to compete the acquisition workflow. *The main Woodruff Library mailroom on Level 2 is not a secure space and collection material should be moved to a secure holdings location as soon as possible upon arrival.*

When materials are brought to Rose Library, the responsible party will confirm what material has arrived and if the paperwork is completed. Information about the new acquisition will be entered into Airtable, and any material will be reboxed (as necessary) and stored according to [link to storage information for acquisitions]

### 2.2.2 Airtable and recording the acquisition stage

Airtable is the system used to document the process of acquisitions through accessioning.  When materials come onsite, they are entered into the [Acquisitions & Accessioning base in Airtable](<https://airtable.com/appxehhHnKmdPpzld/tblVOysdj8gmTooGt/viwM1W5reGNIwQRe3?blocks=hide>) and updated as the Collections Archivist moves through the process. 

Curators should submit Potential Acquisitions Report Form for [MSS](<https://airtable.com/shrFpKc5EDLllbV5j>) or for [Books](<https://airtable.com/shrsr8NWrF9B5F5Cx>) with as much information as possible. The forms should be submitted for all significant acquisitions where significant refers to either the size or the scope of the collection. This information will populate a record in the *Potential and/or Not yet Received Acquisitions (MSS/EUA)* table.  It will appear in the "Cataloging Views" section for acquisitions that include books and the "Accessioning Views" section for acquisitions that include manuscript material. 

While it is best if materials and paperwork are logged together, materials without paperwork or just the paperwork (before the physical transfer of materials) can be logged into Airtable. The Head of Processing should confirm the record has not been started by searching for information about the collection in the *Potential and/or Not yet Received Acquisitions (MSS/EUA)* table and create or update that record with any information from the deed or materials.

See [2.4.1 Managing Paperwork in SharePoint](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/02-ACQUISITIONS#241-managing-paperwork-in-sharepoint>) for information in identifying paperwork location

#### 2.2.2.1 When acquisition require curatorial review
Move the materials to the Curatorial Review shelves (L9-32a) with a physical copy of the paperwork and document that location in Airtable. Alert the appropriate curator that material is ready to be reviewed and provide the location and any questions or concerns that are identified. The curator will make the final decision on whether to move forward with the acquisition.

**If the curator decides not to move forward with an acquisition**
It is the curator's responsibility to notify the donor/seller that materials are being returned and return those materials. The Head of Processing can help coordinate return of the material once the donor/seller has been notified by the curator. 

**If the curator decides to move forward with the acquisition**
The curator will let the Head of Processing know to start the acquisition process.  The Head of Processing will return to the *Potential and/or Not yet Received Acquisitions (MSS/EUA)* section and complete the record, marking the stage as *Ready for Accessioning* and assign the acquisition to an archivist.  If the Head of Processing can move forward with the accession at that time, they should follow through with the accessioning.  Otherwise, the Head of Processing should create the stub accessioning record and complete the acquisition workflow, placing materials on the appropriate shelving.

#### 2.2.2.1 Acquisition approved to move forward
If the Curator approves acquisition, and the materials and paperwork are complete and on-site, the Head of Processing will rebox the materials (as necessary), label the boxes with *Acquisition* labels (see 2.3 New acquisition storage and labeling](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/blob/master/02-ACQUISITIONS/readme.md#23-new-acquisition-storage-and-labeling>)), and set the Airtable stage to *Ready for Accessioning*. 

### 2.2.3 ArchivesSpace stub accession record
To create the Accessioning stub record, first **identify the next accession number** by clicking on the "Browse" button on the top left and selecting Accessions.  Sort by identifier (the ArchivesSpace name for accession number) to see the most recent and assign the next number in sequence.
<kbd><p align="center"><img src="/03-ACCESSIONING/Images/figure5.png" alt="Figure 5: Find accession number" width="75%"/></p></kbd>

The whole of the identifier should be included in the first field with components separated by dashes (e.g., 2024-11-02) where the first component is the four-digit year, the second is the two-digit month, and the last is a two-digit number that is the next consecutive number of accessions in that month.  If the last accession number corresponds to the previous month, then the last portion of the accession number should return to "01," (i.e., the first accession of February should be "YYYY-02-01")

Once you have identified the accession number, you will click on "Create" and select Accession.

#### 2.3.2.2 Dates sub-record
*	All accession records require at least one dates subrecord. 
 	-	Add separate subrecords for each type of date being described, for example inclusive and bulk dates. 
   	-	More than one dates subrecord should be rare in accession records.
*	To add a date subrecord, click the "Add Date" button in the right corner of the subrecord.
  	<kbd><p align="center"><img src="/03-ACCESSIONING/Images/figure13.png" alt="Figure 13: Add Accessioning Date" width="75%"/></p></kbd>
* 	See [6.1.7 Dates](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/06-DESCRIPTION#617-dates>)


#### 2.2.3.3 Extents sub-record
*	All accession records require an extents subrecord.
*	Since the accession record doesn't have the option to automate the creation of an extent field, this must be filled in by the archivist.

The table contains information where the content in the accession record deviates from [6.1.8 Extent](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/06-DESCRIPTION#618-extent>)


| Field                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|**Physical Details [Optional]**|Use this field for any additional, pertinent details describing the physical state of the collection.|
|**Dimensions [Optional]**|This field will rarely be used for manuscript accessionins, but it can be used to note and additional, physical dimensions of the accession|

#### 2.2.3.4 Agent links sub-record 
An agent is a person, corporate body, family, or software responsible in some way for the creation or management of a described resource, or the subject of that resource. 

Accession records require two Agent links:
*	Role [Required]
	-	Select **Source** from the drop down menu to identify the donor/supplier of the acquisition
 	-	Select **Creator** from the drop down menu to identify the content creator of the acquisition materials
*	Agent [Required]
  	-	Using the drop down menu, select *Browse* to search for the name of the Role selected
   	-	If the *Agent Name* has not been already been created in our system, create the name using the workflow found in the [RoseLibrary_AgentRecords](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B1BCB89E9-869E-4154-ABA8-432270A243C0%7D&file=RoseLibrary_AgentRecords.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true>)
*	Relator [Optional]
  	-	Can be used if archivist finds the content to be helpful or appropriateto indicate a more specific relationship of the creator/source to the material being described.
   	-	Rarely used	

#### 2.2.3.5 Related Resources sub-record 
[Required]
*	All accession records must be linked to a resource record.
	-	When the accession is establishing a new collection, this field autopopulate upon the spawning of a Resource Record from the Accession Record and establish a link between the two.
 	-	When the accession is an addition to a collection, the field will autopopulate with titles as you type in the Resource record title or you can click the drop down menu to *Browse* collection titles.

#### 2.2.3.6 Related Accessions sub-record
[Preferred when applicable]
This subrecord links related accessions. It should be used only when material that is acquired together is accessioned into different collections and not linked to the same resource record. 
*	Use this record when:
	-	Multiple collections are created out of one acquisition from a single donor (e.g., the Pauline Brown Payne papers and Homer G. Phillips Hospital records)
	-	A single donor sends additions to multiple collections under one deed (e.g., a Michael Lomax accession that includes additions to both his papers and Almena Lomax's papers).
*	Do not link accessions for miscellany collections.
*	The easiest way to link accessions is to create the record for the first accession, then generate the Related Accession link between the subsequent accessions as they are created.
  	-	The original accession will use the "has part" designation to the subsequent accessions
   	-	Choose "forms part of" when completing the subsequent accessions.
      
To create a related accession
*	Click the "Add Related Accession" button in the right corner.
*	From the "Relationship Type" drop down menu, select "Part of" to indicate that material has been acquired as part of a larger whole.
	-	**The "Sibling Relationship" will not be used in Rose Library records**
 	-	The sibling relationship is for linking accession records of accruals to the same collection. Rose Library will be tracking those relationships in the resource record, not the accession record.
*	From the "This accession" field, use the drop down menu to select:
	-	"Has part" to identify the original accession
 	-	"Forms part of" to signify the subsequent accessions
*	Type the title into the "Accession" search box and select the correct accession record
*	"Relator type" autopulates as "Part of"

Below is an example of the Pauline Brown Payne papers (accession number 2017-02-05) being linked to the accession record for the Homer G. Phillips School of Nursing records (accession number 2016-12-13).

#### 2.2.3.7 External documents sub-record
This field defined the location of the paperwork found in the Sharepoint Acquisitions folder.

Click the button to Add Externa Document and fill in the Title and Location.
*	Title: File name of the deed or other paperwork located in the 
*	Location: Link to the paperwork from the Sharepoint Acquisitions folder

#### 2.2.3.8 Instances sub-record
Create Instances for each container following the steps outlined in the **[Archives Section on Creating Top Containers to be created]**. These will be removed when the collection is accessioned and the Instances are replaced with permanent Top Containers.

#### 2.2.3.9 User defined sub-record
This subrecord records the purchase price or appraisal value for accessions. While not regularly used, we will still record appraisal information if available.

To create a new user defined fields subrecord, click "Add User Defined Fields" in the right corner of the subrecord.  Include the price paid for purchased acquisitions as well as the currency.

#### 2.2.3.10 Event records
Event records document the transfer of the materials and of the paperwork.

In the top right corner of the accession record, click on the *Add Event* drop down and choose:

## 2.3 New acquisition storage and labeling
**Storage for manuscript acquisitions and books without completed paperwork** are held on the shelves located at 09-32a.  These ranges are assigned to the curators based on subject area.  Materials that need further curatorial review are also housed on these shelves.  In cases where the acquisition is large enough to require more space, the location information will be included in the [Airtable Acquisitions and Accessioning base](<https://airtable.com/appxehhHnKmdPpzld/tblVOysdj8gmTooGt/viwE90ZM7CdMKCJDR?blocks=hide>).

**Storage for manuscript acquisitions with completed paperwork** that are:
*	Smaller than 5 linear feet will be stored on the L9 storage shelves located at 09-09b, given space. 
*	Identified by number of items (usually additions to miscellany or artificial collections) will be stored on the accession area shelves.
*	Larger than 5 linear feet may be stored in other holding spaces on Level 9 or 11 and noted in Airtable.
*	Significantly-sized acquisitions can be received at the Library Service Center (LSC), but accessioning and minimal processing must be done on-site.

Hard drives storing born-digital collection material should be securely stored in the Digital Archives lab while awaiting accessioning. 

All new acquisitions should be labeled with the creator, potential collection title, accession number (or date of receipt if stub record can't be created), and temporary box number upon receipt. Labels can be created using [this template](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Acquision%20labels?csf=1&web=1&e=r40Gef>) or via ArchivesSpace top container page. *If the collection arrives with temporary box numbers do not renumber them, as they may correspond to an inventory completed during packing*.

## 2.4 Paperwork
No collection material may be cataloged or accessioned until the appropriate paperwork has been received. All original paperwork should be transferred to the Associate Director of Collections or the Head of Processing.  

### 2.4.1 Managing Paperwork in SharePoint

Rose staff stores and manages all acquisitions-related paperwork in the Sharepoint Acquisitions folder in the following folders:

*	[Rose Library 
Purchases folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases?csf=1&web=1&e=ENpVuR> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases?csf=1&web=1&e=ENpVuR") 
*	[Rose Library Gifts-in-Kind folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind?csf=1&web=1&e=CBbtB3> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind?csf=1&web=1&e=CBbtB3"). 
*	[Rose Library Inter- and Intra-Institutional Transfers](<(https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Inter-%20and%20Intra-%20Institutional%20Transfers?csf=1&web=1&e=81MvEw>)
*	[Emory University Archives Transfers](<https://emory-my.sharepoint.com/shared?id=%2Fsites%2FEUVRoseLibrary%2FShared%20Documents%2FAcquisitions%2FRose%20Library%20Gifts%2Din%2DKind%2FCurrent%20Year%20and%20Incomplete%20Gifts&listurl=https%3A%2F%2Femory%2Esharepoint%2Ecom%2Fsites%2FEUVRoseLibrary%2FShared%20Documents>)

The organization of these folders is different but should be straight forward. Most staff should not be updating or changing paperwork in these folders but, rather, using them for reference or as part of the accessioning process. As new collections move through the acquisitions process, the Associate Director of Collection Services will update the files and move or update the paperwork as needed. 

[I don't think this is done anymore] *There is a top level folder in the Acquisitions folder called [Potential Acquisitions Reports](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Potential%20Acquisitions%20Reports?csf=1&web=1&e=5VDPmW> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Potential%20Acquisitions%20Reports?csf=1&web=1&e=5VDPmW") for acquisitions to be discussed during curators meetings. When a curator completes the Potential Acquisitions Report form, a formatted Word document of the results will appear in this folder while, simultaneously, a record of the results appears in the Acquisitions & Accessioning Airtable base.*

#### 2.4.1.1 Paperwork for purchased materials [Carrie will need to review this]

The Rose Library requires the following [forms](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms?csf=1&web=1&e=S0KcjO>) for purchases: 
*	Invoice (Associate Director of Collection Services will generate an invoice for purchases from individuals)
*	Deed of Sale or Deed Addendum (for purchases from individuals). A Deed Addendum may be used for purchase of additions to existing collection by the same donor who signed the original deed - original deed can be a deed of sale or deed of gift.
*	Deeds of Sale may require additional signatures. 
	*	For purchases totaling $100,000-$249,999, the deed must also be signed by the Dean and University Librarian.
	*	For purchases totaling $250,000-$999,999, the deed must also be signed by the Deputy Provost for Planning and Administration.
	*	For purchases totaling $1 million and over, the deed must also be signed by the President.
*	Domestic Vendors and Sellers: [Supplier/Individual Information Form (SIIF)](<https://finance.emory.edu/home/procurement/support-center/index.html> "https://finance.emory.edu/home/procurement/support-center/index.html") and [W-9](<https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9> "https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9") _Note that the Supplier/Individual Information Form will only work in Microsoft Excel. Other spreadsheet software, such as Google Sheets and Numbers, will not work. If someone does not have access to MS Excel please send them the old PDF version of the form._
*	International Vendors and Sellers: [Supplier/Individual Information Form (SIIF)](<https://finance.emory.edu/home/procurement/support-center/index.html> "https://finance.emory.edu/home/procurement/support-center/index.html"), [W-8BEN-E (businesses)/W-8BEN](<https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8> "https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8") (individuals), and [Foreign Source Statement](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/Edhk6PQRgFhPuV3wwxkrLEMBJMQ8rWH6lJoODmL8KgGCuQ?e=aNYk5u> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/Edhk6PQRgFhPuV3wwxkrLEMBJMQ8rWH6lJoODmL8KgGCuQ?e=aNYk5u") (Note: These must be submitted with the vendor every time they are paid, regardless of how long it has been since they were last paid.)
*	Vendor Forms are required when any of the following are true: 
	*	The Rose Library has never purchased from the seller.
	*	The Rose Library has not purchased from the seller within the last 14 months
	*	The seller's information (including address) has changed since we last purchased material from them

The Rose Library manages the purchase paperwork on Sharepoint through the [Rose Library Purchases 
folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases?csf=1&web=1&e=ENpVuR> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases?csf=1&web=1&e=ENpVuR"). 

#### 2.4.1.2 Paperwork for Gifts in Kind

The following [paperwork](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind/Gift%20Process%20Files%20and%20Forms?csf=1&web=1&e=bdpFf4> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind/Gift%20Process%20Files%20and%20Forms?csf=1&web=1&e=bdpFf4") is required to process and accession gifts: 

*	Signed Gift-in-Kind Contribution Form (required by Advancement and Almnii Engagement (AAE) for all gifts) with a monetary valuation provided by the donor
*	Deed of Gift (long) (required for new manuscript or book collections or additions to existing manuscript or book collections by a new donor)
**OR**
*	Deed of Gift (short) (required for additions of manuscript material to existing artificial collections, such as Black print culture collection, or small additions of books to existing book collections, such as the Danowski Poetry Library)
**OR**
*	Deed Addendum (required for additions to existing collection by the same donor who signed the original deed - original deed can be a deed of sale or deed of gift)

*Please note that the Rose Library does not accept the Gift-in-Kind Contribution Form as documentation for physical, legal, and intellectual transfer. All gifts must be accompanied by a Deed of Gift or Deed Addendum in order to be added to the collection.*
	
The Rose Library manages gift paperwork on OneDrive/SharePoint through the [Rose Library Gifts-in-Kind folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind?csf=1&web=1&e=QMKAK3> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind?csf=1&web=1&e=QMKAK3"). This folder is organized into subfolders by collecting area.

*	Curators are responsible for procuring the appropriate paperwork from donors.
	*	All files should follow the naming convention:  "Donor Name_Calendar Year Received," such as "John Doe_2016."
*	The Head of Processing will reach out to curators to follow up on materials that await paperwork.
*	At the end of the fiscal year, the Accessioning Archivist moves all completed paperwork in the curatorial folders to their respective Past Gifts folders into a new subfolder for the calendar year.

### 2.4.2 Creating the CL-2 File
The permanent collection files document the history of a collection including solicitation, acquisition, processing, and communications with the donor. They will contain transfer paperwork such as deeds of gift or sale and supporting documentation such as invoices, donor correspondence, paper inventories, and other items that help the Rose Library manage and administer the collection.

As part of the acquisition workflow, the Head of Processing will
*	Link the deeds and other acquisitions paperwork (found in the Sharepoint Acquisitions folder) to: 
	-	The ArchivesSpace Accession Record under External Documents
	-	The Airtable record in the Acquisitions & Accessions base in the Paperwork field.
*	Either print out the electronic copy or include the original paperwork with the collection material
*	Write the accession number on the paperwork
*	Create a CL-2 file, if necessary. This includes printing a label and filing the paperwork in the file
  	-	If the acquisition is accessioned by the Head of Processing, they will file the CL-2 folder in the appropriate file cabinet in the L9 Bizhub room
   	-	If the acquisition is to be assigned, the file will be placed with the acquisition materials		

If you pull a collection file from the cabinet for longer than a business day, you must fill out an “out” card with the collection title, your name, and the date. When you return the file, remove the out card and add the date you returned it. One might pull a file while accessioning an addition, processing a collection, or to assist a researcher. Much of the information contained in the collection file is sensitive, and the files are considered confidential. Biographical information, restrictions, rights information, summary collection histories, and inventories may be shared with students and researchers if appropriate.

#### 2.4.2.1 Electronic CL-2 File (Vital Docs Folder)
There are legacy electronic CL-2 files available on SharePoint. These files are no longer maintained since acquisitions paperwork pertaining to new accessions is already maintained on Sharepoint and available through ArchivesSpace and Airtable and can serve as the electronic record. Once material is accessioned, the connection between the paperwork, the accession record, and the collection will be clear in ArchiveSpace. From FY19 forward, please refer to ArchivesSpace, the physical CL-2 file, and/or the electronic acquisitions paperwork for information concerning the history of collections.
