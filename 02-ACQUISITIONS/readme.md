Precustodial work is all work that occurs before a collection is formally and legally transferred to the Rose Library up to an including the creation of an initial stub record in ArchivesSpace. It includes the packing, shipping, and receiving of material (or arrangement thereof), as well as managing the paperwork required to formally transfer a collection or item. Acquisition workflows normally cover the selecting and acquisition of collection material which is the primary responsibility of a Curator and most often refers to the intellectual work of identifying in-scope materials, working with donors, and the physical transfer of both materials and deeds/paperwork which is the common point of intersection between the curatorial team and the processing team.  While the curatorial team is primarily responsible for acquisitions and precustodial work, Collection Services staff should be prepared to work with donors, vendors, and curators to provide guidance on any precustodial actions taken by the Library. 

Collection Services acquisition workflows include reviewing the documentation and/or the physical collection to ensure that all requirements necessary for starting accessioning are complete and documenting the process of acquisitions awaiting the delivery of the physical materials, the deed, or approval from curators.  Acquisition workflows consists of entering information into the Rose Library systems of records including Airtable and ArchivesSpace as well as reboxing and labeling.

## 2.1 Support for Curators

Prior to a collection being acquired by the Rose Library, curators or collection development archivists may reach out to and consult with the the Head of Collection 
Processing to draft an [Operational Impact Statement](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Manuscript%20Processing%20Flags,%20Forms,%20and%20Templates/Operational%20Impact%20Template.docx?d=wd71816b5768b48e3bd3ba63cd914bd79&csf=1&web=1&e=9I9DqA> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Manuscript%20Processing%20Flags,%20Forms,%20and%20Templates/Operational%20Impact%20Template.docx?d=wd71816b5768b48e3bd3ba63cd914bd79&csf=1&web=1&e=9I9DqA") to assess the overall space and supply needs of a collection, as well as cost of transfer, accessioning, processing, and storing a collection.  

Additionally, Collection Services staff may meet with donors or curators to provide 
guidance and assistance on matters such as: 

*	Packing and shipping (see Sections [14.4 Packing guidelines](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/14-ADMINISTRATIVE#144-packing-guidelines>); [14.5 Moving and shipping collections](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/14-ADMINISTRATIVE#145-moving-and-shipping-collections>); and [14.6 FedEx guidelines](<https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/tree/master/14-ADMINISTRATIVE#146-fedex-guidelines>))
*	Transfer of of born-digital material (see forms and procedures [here](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/Born%20Digital%20Acquisitions%20Documents?csf=1&web=1&e=dQyJsr> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/Born%20Digital%20Acquisitions%20Documents?csf=1&web=1&e=dQyJsr")) 
*	Appraisal
*	Arrangement and description
*	Conservation

## 2.2 Acquisition Workflow

The Associate Director of Collection Services or the subject area curator will contact the Head of Processing to start the acquisition of new materials once both the materials and the signed paperwork are on-site. The Head of Processing will confirm that the paperwork and the materials are onsite and complete.  

### 2.2.1 Potential Acquisitions Report

The Head of Processing will search for the Potential Acquisition Report, created by the curator, in the [Airtable Acquisitions and Accessioning base](<https://airtable.com/appxehhHnKmdPpzld/tblVOysdj8gmTooGt/viwE90ZM7CdMKCJDR?blocks=hide>).  If this hasn't been completed, the Head of Processing can enter this information based on content from the paperwork which should be found in the appropriate [Acquisitions folder](<https://emory-my.sharepoint.com/my?id=%2Fsites%2FEUVRoseLibrary%2FShared%20Documents%2FAcquisitions&listurl=https%3A%2F%2Femory%2Esharepoint%2Ecom%2Fsites%2FEUVRoseLibrary%2FShared%20Documents&remoteItem=%7B%22mp%22%3A%7B%22webAbsoluteUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Femory%2Dmy%2Esharepoint%2Ecom%2Fpersonal%2Flstarra%5Femory%5Fedu%22%2C%22listFullUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Femory%2Dmy%2Esharepoint%2Ecom%2Fpersonal%2Flstarra%5Femory%5Fedu%2FDocuments%22%2C%22rootFolder%22%3A%22%2Fpersonal%2Flstarra%5Femory%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FShared%20Documents%22%7D%2C%22rsi%22%3A%7B%22listFullUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Femory%2Esharepoint%2Ecom%2Fsites%2FEUVRoseLibrary%2FShared%20Documents%22%2C%22rootFolder%22%3A%22%2Fsites%2FEUVRoseLibrary%2FShared%20Documents%2FAcquisitions%22%2C%22webAbsoluteUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Femory%2Esharepoint%2Ecom%2Fsites%2FEUVRoseLibrary%22%7D%7D&viewid=278c9798%2D80be%2D44f0%2Da53c%2D2bd07dcfe9bb>). 


## 2.2 Collections receiving 

Collections receiving is the physical transfer of the collection material from a donor, individual seller, or vendor to the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, & Rare Book Library. 

*	The primary point of contact for collections receiving for Emory University Archives at the Rose Library is the University Archivist. 
*	The primary point of contact for collections receiving for all other units at the Rose Library is the Associate Director of Collection Services (or, as a backup, the Head of Collection Processing).


### 2.2.1 Receipt of New or Potential Acquisitions 

All collection material should be received and opened by staff that did not arrange for the acquisition of the materials. This responsibility should most often fall to the Associate Director of Collection Services or the Head of Processing.

All packages delivered onsite will be delivered to the main Woodruff Library mailroom, and mailroom staff will contact the Head of Processing for pickup or, if acquisition is small, deliver the materials to the tenth-floor mail spaces where the Associate Director of Collection Services will review materials and pass on to the Head of Processing to compete the acquisition workflow. The main Woodruff Library mailroom on Level 2 is not a secure space and collection material should be moved to a secure holdings location as soon as possible upon arrival.

The Head of Processing is responsible for the completing the acquisition process for manuscript collection materials while the Associate Director of Collection Services will oversee acquisitions of books. The University Archivist oversees the acquisition and transfer of University Archives materials.

**New Acquisition Storage:**

**Storage for manuscript acquisitions and books without completed paperwork** are held on the shelves located at 09-32a.  Ranges are assigned to the curators based on subject area.  Materials that need further curatorial review are also housed on these shelves.  In cases where the acquisition is large enough to require more space, the location information will be included in the [Airtable Acquisitions and Accessioning base](<https://airtable.com/appxehhHnKmdPpzld/tblVOysdj8gmTooGt/viwE90ZM7CdMKCJDR?blocks=hide>).

**Storage for manuscript acquisitions with completed paperwork** that are:
*	Smaller than 5 linear feet will be stored on the L9 storage shelves located at 09-09b, given space. 
*	Identified by number of items (usually additions to miscellany or artificial collections) will be stored on the accession area shelves.
*	Larger than 5 linear feet may be stored in other holding spaces on Level 9 or 11.
*	Significantly-sized acquisitions can be received at the Library Service Center (LSC) and accessioning and minimal processing can be done on-site there.

Hard drives storing born-digital collection material should be securely stored in the Digital Archives lab while awaiting accessioning. 

All new acquisitions should be labeled with the creator, potential collection title, date of receipt, and temporary box number upon receipt. Labels can be created using [this template](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Manuscript%20%20Labels/Custody%20Transfer%20Labels.doc?d=w2ed7373a42f442e8b84dc4a94de54906&csf=1&web=1&e=OxH4sv> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing/Collection%20Processing%20Templates/Labels/Manuscript%20Box%20Labels/Custody%20Transfer%20Labels.doc?d=w2ed7373a42f442e8b84dc4a94de54906&csf=1&web=1&e=OxH4sv") or via ArchivesSpace. If the collection arrives with temporary box numbers do not renumber them, as they may correspond to an inventory completed during packing.

 Create a stub accession record in [ArchivesSpace](<https://archives.libraries.emory.edu/staff/>) including creating instances for each container received as an "Accession" instance type and with the proper shlef location. The Accessioning Archivist will also create an accompanying custody transfer event record. If the acquisition has an accompanying signed deed of sale or gift or deed addendum at the time of receipt, the Accessioning Archivist will also add an agreement signed event record.
Upon receipt of material the Head of Processing will:  

*	Rebox collection material as appropriate.
*	Log in Airtable in the [Acquisitions and Accessioning base](<https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invIzvJvL7uX2guNB&inviteToken=86acbad9730435fd6c8574d72239aa0de6d53f173b62c30ae242274d50d6e8c3> "https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invIzvJvL7uX2guNB&inviteToken=86acbad9730435fd6c8574d72239aa0de6d53f173b62c30ae242274d50d6e8c3") or update status of existing record in Airtable. 
*	Place the items and any accompanying documentation onto the appropriate curatorial review shelf (for material comprised of 5 linear feet or fewer)
*	Locate stacks space for collection material greater than 5 linear feet and keep accompanying documentation in a secure file to process as needed
*	Alert the appropriate curator that material is ready to be reviewed and provide location if other than curatorial review shelf. The curator will make final decision on whether to move forward with the acquisition.
	
If the curator decides to not move forward with an acquisition, it is the curator's 
responsibility to notify the donor/seller. The Accessioning Archivist
can help coordinate return of the material once the donor/seller has been notified 
by the curator.

For acquisitions logs prior to the implementation of ArchivesSpace, please see the [Rose Acquisitions Log folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Acquisitions%20Log?csf=1&web=1&e=WILjX1> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Acquisitions%20Log?csf=1&web=1&e=WILjX1") on OneDrive.

### 2.2.2 Paperwork<a href="#anchor1"><sup>1</sup></a>

No collection material may be cataloged or accessioned until the appropriate 
paperwork has been received. All original paperwork should be transferred to the Accessioning Archivist.  

**Managing Paperwork in OneDrive/SharePoint**

Rose staff stores and manages all acquisitions-related paperwork on OneDrive. OneDrive allows 
staff to access shared folders and communicate with one another inside the 
application, creating and maintaining a record of communications for each 
acquisition.  

There are two OneDrive folders that we use to manage this process. These can be found in the EUV Rose Library document library under Acquisitions and include the [Rose Library 
Purchases folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases?csf=1&web=1&e=ENpVuR> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases?csf=1&web=1&e=ENpVuR") and the [Rose Library Gifts-in-Kind folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind?csf=1&web=1&e=CBbtB3> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind?csf=1&web=1&e=CBbtB3"). The organization of these folders is different but should be straight forward. Most staff should not be updating or changing paperwork in these folders but, rather, using them for reference or as part of the accessioning process. As new collections move through the acquisitions process, the Accessioning Archivist will update the files and move or update the paperwork as needed. As paperwork moves through the process, the Accessioning Archivist will use the tagging, commenting, and task list functions in OneDrive to update Rose Library and other staff members about the status of the acquisition or to alert someone when an action is required.

There is a top level folder in the Acquisitions folder called [Potential Acquisitions Reports](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Potential%20Acquisitions%20Reports?csf=1&web=1&e=5VDPmW> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Potential%20Acquisitions%20Reports?csf=1&web=1&e=5VDPmW") for acquisitions to be discussed during curators meetings. When a curator completes the Potential Acquisitions Report form, a formatted Word document of the results will appear in this folder while, simultaneously, a record of the results appears in the Acquisitions & Accessioning Airtable base.

**Paperwork Required for Purchase Payment**

The Rose Library requires the following [forms](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms?csf=1&web=1&e=S0KcjO> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases/Process%20Files%20and%20Forms?csf=1&web=1&e=S0KcjO") for purchases: 

*	Invoice (Accessioning Archivist will generate an invoice for purchases from individuals)
*	Deed of Sale or Deed Addendum (for purchases from individuals). A Deed Addendum may be used for purchase of additions to existing collection by the same donor who signed the original deed - original deed can be a deed of sale or deed of gift.
*	Deeds of Sale may require additional signatures. 
	*	For purchases totaling $100,000-$249,999, the deed must also be signed by the Dean and University Librarian.
	*	For purchases totaling $250,000-$999,999, the deed must also be signed by the Deputy Provost for Planning and Administration.
	*	For purchases totaling $1 million and over, the deed must also be signed by the President.
*	Domestic Vendors and Sellers: [Supplier/Individual Information Form (SIIF)](<https://finance.emory.edu/home/procurement/support-center/index.html> "https://finance.emory.edu/home/procurement/support-center/index.html") and [W-9](<https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9> "https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9") _Note that the Supplier/Individual Information Form will only work in Microsoft Excel. Other spreadsheet software, such as Google Sheets and Numbers, will not work. If someone does not have access to MS Excel please send them the old PDF version of the form._
*	International Vendors and Sellers: [Supplier/Individual Information Form (SIIF)](<https://finance.emory.edu/home/procurement/support-center/index.html> "https://finance.emory.edu/home/procurement/support-center/index.html"), [W-8BEN-E (businesses)/W-8BEN](<https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8> "https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8") (individuals), and [Foreign Source Statement](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/Edhk6PQRgFhPuV3wwxkrLEMBJMQ8rWH6lJoODmL8KgGCuQ?e=aNYk5u> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/Edhk6PQRgFhPuV3wwxkrLEMBJMQ8rWH6lJoODmL8KgGCuQ?e=aNYk5u") (Note: These must be submitted with the vendor every time they are paid, regardless of how long it has been since they were last paid.)
*	Vendor Forms are required when any of the following are true: 

	*	The Rose Library has never purchased from the seller.
	*	The Rose Library has not purchased from the seller within the last 14 months
	*	The seller's information (including address) has changed since we last 
		purchased material from them
		
**Managing Purchase Paperwork in OneDrive/SharePoint**

The Rose Library manages purchase paperwork on OneDrive through the [Rose Library Purchases 
folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases?csf=1&web=1&e=ENpVuR> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Purchases?csf=1&web=1&e=ENpVuR"). Prior to discussion at the monthly collection strategies meeting, curators should submit a Potential Acquisitions Report form [via this link for manuscript material](<https://airtable.com/shrFpKc5EDLllbV5j> "https://airtable.com/shrFpKc5EDLllbV5j") or [via this link for rare books](<https://airtable.com/shrsr8NWrF9B5F5Cx> "https://airtable.com/shrsr8NWrF9B5F5Cx"). A Word document will automatically appear in the [Potential Acquisitions Reports folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Potential%20Acquisitions%20Reports?csf=1&web=1&e=jwx8sV> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Potential%20Acquisitions%20Reports?csf=1&web=1&e=jwx8sV"). Curators and archivists may use the Potential Acquisitions Reports folder to upload additional relevant documentation for purchases under consideration, such as appraisal report, inventories, and operational impact statements.

Most of this folder is organized into subfolders by process step. Step 1 is further subdivided by collecting area.   

*	**Step 1:** Received and Pending
	
	*	Accessioning Archivist will upload paperwork for acquisitions received, such as invoices, deeds of sale, or preliminary inventories to this folder. The Accessioning Archivist will also move to this folder any paperwork in the Potential Acquisitions Reports folder that corresponds with acquisitions that have been received to move forward.
	*	Accessioning Archivist requests curatorial review and fund identification for received purchase acquisitions by tagging the appropriate curator in the comments section of the documentation for the acquisition.
	*	Accessioning Archivist confirms whether a seller is an active vendor with the University in [Compass](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Acquisitions%20Instructions%20and%20Policies/Compass%20Overview%20for%20Acquisitions%20for%20Rose%20Library.docx?d=wf496b695833d4048a5e296e400bfe210&csf=1&web=1&e=8WzkJF> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Acquisitions%20Instructions%20and%20Policies/Compass%20Overview%20for%20Acquisitions%20for%20Rose%20Library.docx?d=wf496b695833d4048a5e296e400bfe210&csf=1&web=1&e=8WzkJF") and contacts new or inactive vendors and sellers to obtain vendor paperwork. 
	*	If vendor paperwork is needed, once it is received, the Accessioning Archivist performs a quality check and then submits a [Supplier Request form in Emory Express for processing](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Acquisitions%20Instructions%20and%20Policies/How%20to%20Set%20Up%20a%20New%20Vendor%20with%20Accounts%20Payable.docx?d=w345d6f32665b448b9c395204dd26437e&csf=1&web=1&e=vUNMH1> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Acquisitions%20Instructions%20and%20Policies/How%20to%20Set%20Up%20a%20New%20Vendor%20with%20Accounts%20Payable.docx?d=w345d6f32665b448b9c395204dd26437e&csf=1&web=1&e=vUNMH1").
	*	If required, the curator prepares a Deed of Sale or Deed Addendum for the seller to review. Once reviewed, the Accessioning Archivists requests necessary signatures [using DocuSign](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Acquisitions%20Instructions%20and%20Policies/How%20to%20Use%20DocuSign.docx?d=wfae23216f0fa4263839cec6628bb5e40&csf=1&web=1&e=zmYv43> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Acquisitions%20Instructions%20and%20Policies/How%20to%20Use%20DocuSign.docx?d=wfae23216f0fa4263839cec6628bb5e40&csf=1&web=1&e=zmYv43"). DocuSign will automatically send a copy of the completed deed to the seller.
	*	Curator communicates to the Accessioning Archivist that they have reviewed the material and which fund to use
	*	Accessioning Archivist confirms that all required paperwork has been submitted and is complete and combines the vital documents into one file. Vital documents include the invoice and the Deed of Sale or Deed Addendum when applicable.
	*	File titles should be structured to include the vendor name, invoice number and fiscal year. For example: "Vendor or Seller Name_Invoice Number_Fiscal Year," such as "John Doe Bookseller_123456_FY17." 
	*	Once all paperwork is submitted, the Accessioning Archivist moves the file to step 2 if further approval is needed and to Step 3 if not.
	
*	**Step 2:** In Process
	
	*	Accessioning Archivist communicates with the Director to approve the disbursement of endowed and restricted funds when this approval has not previously been communicated via the curators' monthly meeting
	*	If the vendor record in Compass needed to be created or updated in the previous step, the Accessioning Archivist will [create or update the vendor record in Alma](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Acquisitions%20Instructions%20and%20Policies/How%20to%20Create%20a%20Vendor%20Record%20in%20Alma.docx?d=w9ec8a09b64bf41f68f5016d30177feb8&csf=1&web=1&e=QY2MDe> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Acquisitions%20Instructions%20and%20Policies/How%20to%20Create%20a%20Vendor%20Record%20in%20Alma.docx?d=w9ec8a09b64bf41f68f5016d30177feb8&csf=1&web=1&e=QY2MDe")
	*	Accessioning Archivist will [submit the payment in Alma](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Acquisitions%20Instructions%20and%20Policies/Procedures%20for%20Paying%20for%20Collection%20Material%20in%20Alma.docx?d=w91b4c9eabafd4763bbefd7bc2385a542&csf=1&web=1&e=SMRGva> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Acquisitions%20Instructions%20and%20Policies/Procedures%20for%20Paying%20for%20Collection%20Material%20in%20Alma.docx?d=w91b4c9eabafd4763bbefd7bc2385a542&csf=1&web=1&e=SMRGva")
	*	Accessioning Archivist moves the file to step 3.
	
*	**Step 3:** Verified

	*	Accessioning Archivist contacts the Budget Analyst and Senior Accounting Assistant in Finance with the PO number
	*	For the purposes of the Rose Library, the acquisition is considered paid for and can move forward for accessioning or cataloging.
	*	If the purchase contains any amount of manuscript material, the Accessioning Archivist will physically move material comprised of 5 linear feet or fewer to shelving in the accessioning area, as space allows.
	*	If the purchase contains any amount of print material, the Accessioning Archivist will physically move material to shelving in the recent acquisitions range on Level 9 for cataloging.
	*	When acquisitions contain both manuscript and print material, the original paperwork stays with the manuscript material to be placed in the permanent collection file (CL-2) upon accessioning and a copy of the paperwork will be placed with the print material.
	*	At some future point, the Senior Accounting Assistant or Budget Analyst in Finance will communicate final payment information.
			
At the end of each fiscal year, the Accessioning Archivist moves all completed paperwork in the Step 3 folder for purchases into the Past Fiscal Years folder and into a new subfolder titled "FY--" (e.g., FY16).

**Paperwork Required for Gifts in Kind**

The following [paperwork](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind/Gift%20Process%20Files%20and%20Forms?csf=1&web=1&e=bdpFf4> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind/Gift%20Process%20Files%20and%20Forms?csf=1&web=1&e=bdpFf4") is required to process and accession gifts:

*Please note that the Rose Library does not accept the Gift-in-Kind Contribution Form as documentation for physical, legal, and intellectual transfer. All gifts must be accompanied by a Deed of Gift or Deed Addendum in order to be added to the collection.*

The Rose Library manages gift paperwork on OneDrive/SharePoint through the [Rose Library Gifts-in-Kind folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind?csf=1&web=1&e=QMKAK3> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind?csf=1&web=1&e=QMKAK3"). This folder is organized into subfolders by collecting area. The Accessioning Archivist is responsible for combining paperwork into a single PDF file and communicating with appropriate parties for next steps. Prior to discussion at the monthly collection strategies meeting, curators should submit a Potential Acquisitions Report form [via this link for manuscript material](<https://airtable.com/shr8v650lYopVasKM> "https://airtable.com/shr8v650lYopVasKM") or [via this link for rare books](<https://airtable.com/shrpTxBSQQyky5vjH> "https://airtable.com/shrpTxBSQQyky5vjH"). A Word document will automatically appear in the [Potential Acquisitions Reports folder](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Potential%20Acquisitions%20Reports?csf=1&web=1&e=jwx8sV> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Potential%20Acquisitions%20Reports?csf=1&web=1&e=jwx8sV"). Curators and archivists may use the Potential Acquisitions Reports folder to upload additional relevant documentation for gifts under consideration, such as appraisal report, inventories, and operational impact statements.

**The gifts process includes the following steps:**

1.	Curators or Accessioning Archivist uploads preliminary paperwork for acquisitions received. This could include potential acquisitions report forms, appraisal reports, or notes detailing conversations and negotiations with donors.  
	*	Curators are responsible for procuring the appropriate paperwork from donors.
	*	All files should follow the naming convention:  "Donor Name_Calendar Year Received," such as "John Doe_2016."
2.	Once all draft paperwork for an acquisition has been received, the Accessioning Archivist drafts an acknowledgment letter
3.	Using [these instructions](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Acquisitions%20Instructions%20and%20Policies/How%20to%20Use%20DocuSign.docx?d=wfae23216f0fa4263839cec6628bb5e40&csf=1&web=1&e=5XgxMR> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Acquisitions%20Instructions%20and%20Policies/How%20to%20Use%20DocuSign.docx?d=wfae23216f0fa4263839cec6628bb5e40&csf=1&web=1&e=5XgxMR") the Accessioning Archivist submits the deed, Gift-in-Kind Contribution Form, and acknowledgement letter to DocuSign for signatures from all parties.
4.	Once the paperwork is completed, a copy will automatically be sent to the donor via DocuSign
5.	Accessioning Archivist will communicate with the Assistant Director of Alumni and Advancement Engagement (AAE) to let them know that the gift is ready for recording.
6.	If the gift contains any amount of manuscript material, the Accessioning Archivist will physically move material comprised of 5 linear feet or fewer to shelving in the accessioning area, as space allows.
7.	If the gift contains any amount of print material, the Accessioning Archivist will physically move material to shelving in the recent acquisitions range on Level 9 for cataloging.
8.	When acquisitions contain both manuscript and print material, the original paperwork stays with the manuscript material to be placed in the permanent collection file (CL-2) upon accessioning and a copy of the paperwork will be placed with the print material.
				
At the end of the calendar year, the Accessioning Archivist moves all completed paperwork in the curatorial folders to their respective Past Gifts folders into a new subfolder for the calendar year.

Unsolicited gifts received are documented in the curatorial folders, usually with a Word document, but may be represented with a letter, or other documentation from the donor. When creating a Word document for an unsolicited gift, include contact information for the donor, the contents of the gift, the physical size of the gift, and the date of arrival. The curator must confirm that they would like to accept these gifts prior to moving forward. The Accessioning Archivist is responsible for following up with the donor to obtain proper paperwork only when the curator does not have a prior relationship with the donor.

While Rose Library staff will make an effort to obtain a Gift-in-Kind Contribution Form for AAE, it is ultimately the responsibility of AAE to obtain this form from donors. AAE should primarily work with curators to obtain this form, as opposed to Collection Services staff.

### 2.2.3 Financial Appraisal

Collections may be appraised in two circumstances:

1. If a donor would like to take a tax write-off greater than $5000 on a gift or;
2. If curators need a professional evaluation to determine a fair purchase price for a prospective acquisition.   

It is the donor's responsibility to arrange and pay for appraisals for tax purposes.

Every effort should be made to arrange financial appraisal of collection material prior to physical transfer to the Rose Library.

Please refer to [this reference sheet](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind/Gift%20Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/Rose%20Library%20Gift-in-Kind%20Tax%20Deduction%20Cheat%20Sheet.docx?d=w907353aff3534c72ab94f646c88be5fa&csf=1&web=1&e=A4qViB> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Acquisitions/Rose%20Library%20Gifts-in-Kind/Gift%20Process%20Files%20and%20Forms/Rose%20Library%20Gift-in-Kind%20Tax%20Deduction%20Cheat%20Sheet.docx?d=w907353aff3534c72ab94f646c88be5fa&csf=1&web=1&e=A4qViB") concerning tax deductions for more information about charitable gifts.

Collection Services staff may occasionally be called on to assist in coordinating and facilitating financial appraisals of Rose Library collections or potential acquisitions. While we can facilitate the work of professional appraisers, Rose Library staff cannot provide or estimate a value for any special collections material per the [ACRL Code of Ethics for Special Collections Librarians](<http://rbms.info/standards/code_of_ethics/> "http://rbms.info/standards/code_of_ethics/"), nor can we provide any tax advice to donors.  

If a curator or administrator chooses to engage an appraiser, they must schedule the appointment with the appraiser and contact the Accessioning Archivist or Assistant Director for Collection Strategies as early as possible.

Once an appraisal is scheduled, the Accessioning Archivist will: 

*	Reserve the Folio Room for the appointment  
*	Notify Research Services staff
*	Move the material to the Collections Transition Room (CTR) in advance of the visit
*	Return material to its holding location when the appraisal is concluded

Invoices for an appraiser’s services should be directed to the Operational Manager. Appraisal reports prepared for collection material we are acquiring should be provided to the Accessioning Archivist, who will post them to OneDrive for everyone’s access.  

**NOTE:** This is the only instance when unaccessioned and uncataloged material should be stored in the CTR and/or made available in the Reading Room. Collection Services is not responsible for assisting the appraiser with any billing or travel issues; those inquiries should be directed to the Operational Manager.

On very rare occasions, it may be requested that financial appraisal be conducted on collections too large to move to the CTR. This requires additional notice to properly staff the appraiser during their stay on our secure floor. It is not the responsibility of Collection Services staff to accompany the appraiser but, rather, the responsibility of the curator.

###Accessioning Workflow


*	If creating a new collection, assign an identifier to the collection by assigning the next number in sequence in the [Manuscript Register](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Cataloging%20and%20Collection%20Processing/Stacks%20Management/Shelf%20Lists/Manuscript%20Register.xlsx?d=w870976b852d84f80b0d6490280b167e5&csf=1&web=1&e=Vg0Tkk) or [EUA Register](https://emory.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/EUVRoseLibrary/EQyyLS-B7fVHvYOf7t0JLbEBLW_YsrF0AOagwRBVceoxKw?e=MCihpT). See [Description 5.1.3: Identifier](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/blob/master/05-DESCRIPTION/readme.md#513-identifier) for more information about assigning an identifier.
*	Link to an existing resource record for additions to collections or spawn a new resource record for new collections and complete the form according to the [Emory Libraries Resource Record Field Usage Guidelines](<https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/ResourceRecord_Field_Usage_Guidelines.docx?d=wb0edbbbcf08c4d40a773abe1d5a61fb4&csf=1&web=1&e=zT4xfE> "https://emory.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/EUVRoseLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Systems/ArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpace%20Workflow%20and%20Instruction%20Docs/ResourceRecord_Field_Usage_Guidelines.docx?d=wb0edbbbcf08c4d40a773abe1d5a61fb4&csf=1&web=1&e=zT4xfE") for stub resource records
*	Print any needed documentation from OneDrive using the external documents link in the accession record and combine with any physical documentation in hand to add to or create the physical CL-2 file. Write the accession number on the deed, if present, or on the invoice if there is no deed.
*	Process the material at whichever level is deemed appropriate and create description according to the policies and procedures outlined in the Rose Library Collection Services Manual.
*	Update the status of the acquisition in the [Acquisitions & Accessioning Airtable base](<https://airtable.com/shrCBB24THckYDtOa> "https://airtable.com/shrCBB24THckYDtOa"). Changing the status to "Complete" will automatically send the curator an email.

The below instructions explain how to make accession records from start to finish. However, please note that most staff will not be creating any records from scratch. Navigate to the part of the instructions applicable to your piece of the workflow.

## 3.2 Creation of the Accession Record

#### Deaccessions Subrecord [Required when applicable]

Add a deaccessions subrecord to record deaccessions contemporaneous to the accession. 
To create a deaccessions subrecord, click "Add Deaccession" in the upper right corner.

![Figure 24: Add Deaccessions Subrecord](/03-ACCESSIONING/Images/figure24.png "Figure 24: Add Deaccessions Subrecord")

| Field                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Portion                             | Select part or whole from the drop down menu as appropriate. |
| Description                             | Free text field. Describe the material being deaccessioned. |
| Reason                             | Free text field.  Record the reason for the deaccession. |
| Disposition                             | Free text field.  Record the disposition of the material (e.g., shredded, returned, transferred, etc.) |
| Notification given                             | Check the box if applicable. |
| Deaccession Date                             | Label should be Deaccession. Complete the rest of the Deaccession Date subrecord according to the rules established for the Dates sub-record |
| Extent                             | Record the extent of the deaccessioned material according to the rules established for the Extent sub-record  |

#### Collection Management Subrecord

Use this field to record internal information about processing the material. Use of this subrecord for accessions may be rare and will likely not be completed by the accessioning archivist. This field is likely most useful at the point of accessioning when describing plans for processed collections with unprocessed additions.

#### Classifications Subrecord

This subfield is not applicable to Emory University special collections material.

#### User Defined Fields Subrecord [Required]

This subrecord is where you will record the purchase price or appraisal value for accessions.

To create a new user defined fields subrecord, click "Add User Defined Fields" in the right corner of the subrecord.

![Figure 25: Add User Defined Fields Subrecord](/03-ACCESSIONING/Images/figure25.png "Figure 25: Add User Defined Fields Subrecord")

Note that there are many possible fields in this subrecord and only four that Rose Library is interested in: Appraisal value, appraisal date, purchase price, and purchase price currency. The first three are close to each other, and the fourth is farther down the subrecord.

Enter the appraisal value and/or purchase price in the appropriate field. If a purchase was also appraised, always record both values. Only record the appraisal value and date if an official financial appraisal was conducted for the material. Do not record donors' financial valuations of material on Gift-in-Kind Contribution forms if no appraisal report is present.

![Figure 26: Apprisal value and purchase price](/03-ACCESSIONING/Images/figure26.png "Figure 26: Appraisal value and purchase price")

If the collection was financially appraised, select the date of appraisal in the Appraisal date field.

![Figure 27: Appraisal date](/03-ACCESSIONING/Images/figure27.png "Figure 27: Appraisal date")

If the collection is a purchase, also record the currency in which the purchase was made. Most common will be U.S. Dollars and U.K. Pounds.

![Figure 28: Purchase price currency](/03-ACCESSIONING/Images/figure28.png "Figure 28: Purchase price currency")

**Finalizing the record**

When you have finished filling out the record, press the Save button. At this point you may spawn a resource record for new collections, as well as add event records to the accession record as needed. Record the accession number on the aperwork filed in the physical CL-2 file.
